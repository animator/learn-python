## Process

**Step 1**: Raise a **new issue** that you want to "Add <Your content title> content". We will assign the issue to you and label it.  
**Do not choose an entire topic or a whole bunch of sections. Just choose a single small section for which you will be contributing when you raise a new issue.**  
**Step 2**: Star and fork THIS repository.  
**Step 3**: Now in your fork, go the correct topic folder as provided in the links above.  
**Step 4**: Edit `index.md` file to add the title of the content and the corresponding file name where the content will be available in this folder.  
**Step 5**: Add the content in markdown format in the file (extension `.md`).  
**Step 6**: Raise a PR with your changes. Accept the pledge that the content is original and not stolen from any other source.  
**Step 7**: Wait for review and PR merge.
