# Introduction

## What is NumPy?

NumPy is a powerful array-processing library in Python, essential for scientific computing. It provides efficient data structures and tools for working with multidimensional arrays.

## Key Features

1. **Efficient Arrays:** NumPy offers high-performance N-dimensional array objects for swift data manipulation.
2. **Broadcasting:** Advanced broadcasting enables seamless element-wise operations on arrays of varying shapes.
3. **Interoperability:** NumPy seamlessly integrates with C, C++, and Fortran, enhancing performance and versatility.
4. **Mathematical Tools:** Comprehensive support for linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and random number generation.

## Installation

Ensure Python is installed in your system. If not you can install it from here([official Python website](https://www.python.org/)),then install NumPy via:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Importing NumPy

To access NumPy functions, import it with the alias `np`.

```python
import numpy as np
```

Using `np` as an alias enhances code readability and is a widely adopted convention.
