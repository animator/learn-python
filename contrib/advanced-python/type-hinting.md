# Introduction to Type Hinting in Python
Type hinting is a feature in Python that allows you to specify the expected data types of variables, function arguments, and return values. It was introduced 
in Python 3.5 via PEP 484 and has since become a standard practice to improve code readability and facilitate static analysis tools.

**Benefits of Type Hinting**

1. Improved Readability: Type hints make it clear what type of data is expected, making the code easier to understand for others and your future self.
2. Error Detection: Static analysis tools like MyPy can use type hints to detect type errors before runtime, reducing bugs and improving code quality.
3.Better Tooling Support: Modern IDEs and editors can leverage type hints to provide better autocompletion, refactoring, and error checking features.
4. Documentation: Type hints serve as a form of documentation, indicating the intended usage of functions and classes.

**Syntax of Type Hinting** <br>
Type hints can be added to variables, function arguments, and return values using annotations.

1. Variable Annotations:

```bash
age: int = 25
name: str = "Alice"
is_student: bool = True
```

2. Function Annotations:

```bash
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

3. Multiple Arguments and Return Types:

```bash
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
```

4. Optional Types: Use the Optional type from the typing module for values that could be None.

```bash
from typing import Optional

def get_user_name(user_id: int) -> Optional[str]:
    # Function logic here
    return None  # Example return value
```

5. Union Types: Use the Union type when a variable can be of multiple types.

```bash
from typing import Union

def get_value(key: str) -> Union[int, str]:
    # Function logic here
    return "value"  # Example return value
```

6. List and Dictionary Types: Use the List and Dict types from the typing module for collections.

```bash
from typing import List, Dict

def process_data(data: List[int]) -> Dict[str, int]:
    # Function logic here
    return {"sum": sum(data)}  # Example return value
```

7. Type Aliases: Create type aliases for complex types to make the code more readable.

```bash
from typing import List, Tuple

Coordinates = List[Tuple[int, int]]

def draw_shape(points: Coordinates) -> None:
    # Function logic here
    pass
```

**Example of Type Hinting in a Class** <br>
Here is a more comprehensive example using type hints in a class:

```bash
from typing import List

class Student:
    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int, grades: List[int]) -> None:
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.grades = grades

    def average_grade(self) -> float:
        return sum(self.grades) / len(self.grades)

    def add_grade(self, grade: int) -> None:
        self.grades.append(grade)

# Example usage
student = Student("Alice", 20, [90, 85, 88])
print(student.average_grade())  # Output: 87.66666666666667
student.add_grade(92)
print(student.average_grade())  # Output: 88.75
```

### Conclusion
Type hinting in Python enhances code readability, facilitates error detection through static analysis, and improves tooling support. By adopting 
type hinting, you can write clearer and more maintainable code, reducing the likelihood of bugs and making your codebase easier to navigate for yourself and others.
