Scrapping Pubmed Data Using Beautiful Soup


This Python script fetches information from PubMed related to a user-defined topic. It retrieves citation details, authors' information, abstracts, and PMCID (PubMed Central ID) for each publication on the topic. The script then saves this information as a JSON file. To ensure compliance with rate limits on PubMed's API, it employs rate limiting and retry mechanisms for HTTP errors, particularly error code 429 (rate limit exceeded). Finally, it prompts the user to enter a topic, scrapes PubMed for relevant publications, and saves the fetched data into a JSON file named after the topic

    Title: Emulation and evaluation of tumor cell combined chemotherapy in isotropic/anisotropic collagen fiber microenvironments.
    Authors: Zhou L, Li G, Yao J, Wang J, Yao X, Ye Z, Zheng D, Song K, Zhang H, Zhang X, Shuai J, Ye F, Li M, Li Y, Chen G, Cheng Y, Liu H, Shaw P, Liu L
    Abstract: The rapid emergence of anisotropic collagen fibers in the tissue microenvironment is a critical transition point in late-stage breast cancer. Specifically, the fiber orientation facilitates the likelihood of high-speed tumor cell invasion and metastasis, which pose lethal threats to patients. Thus, based on this transition point, one key issue is how to determine and evaluate efficient combination chemotherapy treatments in late-stage cancer. In this study, we designed a collagen microarray chip containing 241 high-throughput microchambers with embedded metastatic breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231-RFP. By utilizing collagen's unique structure and hydromechanical properties, the chip constructed three-dimensional isotropic and anisotropic collagen fiber structures to emulate the tumor cell microenvironment at early and late stages. We injected different chemotherapeutic drugs into its four channels and obtained composite biochemical concentration profiles. Our results demonstrate that anisotropic collagen fibers promote cell proliferation and migration more than isotropic collagen fibers, suggesting that the geometric arrangement of fibers plays an important role in regulating cell behavior. Moreover, the presence of anisotropic collagen fibers may be a potential factor leading to the poor efficacy of combined chemotherapy in late-stage breast cancer. We investigated the efficacy of various chemotherapy drugs using cell proliferation inhibitors paclitaxel and gemcitabine and tumor cell migration inhibitors 7rh and PP2. To ensure the validity of our findings, we followed a systematic approach that involved testing the inhibitory effects of these drugs. According to our results, the drug combinations' effectiveness could be ordered as follows: paclitaxel + gemcitabine > gemcitabine + 7rh > PP2 + paclitaxel > 7rh + PP2. This study shows that the biomimetic chip system not only facilitates the creation of a realistic in vitro model for examining the cell migration mechanism in late-stage breast cancer but also has the potential to function as an effective tool for future chemotherapy assessment and personalized medicine.

    Title: Homologous-targeting biomimetic nanoparticles co-loaded with melittin and a photosensitizer for the combination therapy of triple negative breast cancer.
    Authors: Zhang T, Bai L, You R, Yang M, Chen Q, Cheng Y, Qian Z, Wang Y, Liu Y
    Abstract: Melittin (Mel) is considered a promising candidate drug for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) due to its various antitumor effects. However, its clinical application is hampered by notable limitations, including hemolytic activity, rapid clearance, and a lack of tumor selectivity. Here, we designed novel biomimetic nanoparticles based on homologous tumor cell membranes and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)/poly(beta-aminoester) (PBAE), denoted MDM@TPP, which efficiently coloaded the cytolytic peptide Mel and the photosensitizer mTHPC. Both in vitro and in vivo, the MDM@TPP nanoparticles effectively mitigated the acute toxicity of melittin and exhibited strong TNBC targeting ability due to the homologous targeting effect of the tumor cell membrane. Under laser irradiation, the MDM@TPP nanoparticles showed excellent photodynamic performance and thus accelerated the release of Mel by disrupting cell membrane integrity. Moreover, Mel combined with photodynamic therapy (PDT) can synergistically kill tumor cells and induce significant immunogenic cell death, thereby stimulating the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs). In 4T1 tumor-bearing mice, MDM@TPP nanoparticles effectively inhibited the growth and metastasis of primary tumors and finally prevented tumor recurrence by improving the immune response.

    Title: [Study of metal organic framework with siRNA for overcoming matrix barrierin breast cancer].
    Authors: Zeng C, Zhang J
    Abstract: Objective: This study aimed to develop a new delivery strategy that utilized metal organic framework (MOF) loaded with small-interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting ITGAV to overcome tumor matrix barrier, and thus enhance drug penetration and immune accessibility in breast cancer. Methods: MOF@siITGAV particles were constructed and characterized. The uptake of MOF@siITGAV in breast cancer cell line 4T1 was observed by the cellular uptake assay. The toxicity of MOF@siITGAV was detected by cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8). The blank control group, naked siITGAV group and MOF@siITGAV group were set. Real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot were used to detect the expressions of ITGAV. The level of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) in the cell culture medium was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The penetration of MOF@siITGAV in 4T1 cells was tested by constructing 3D spheroids. Mouse models of triple negative breast cancer were established. The effect of MOF@siITGAV on the growth of transplanted tumors and main organs was verified. Imminohistochemical (IHC) was used to test the expression of collagen and CD8. Results: MOF@siITGAV particles were constructed with sizes of (198.0+/-3.3) nm and zeta potential of -(20.2+/-0.4) mV. MOF@siITGAV could be engulfed by 4T1 cells and triggered to release siRNA. Compared to the blank control group, the expression of ITGAV in the MOF@siITGAV group [(46.5+/-11.3)%] and the naked siITGAV group [(109.9+/-19.0)%] was lower. TGF-beta1 in the cell culture medium of the blank control group, naked siITGAV group, and MOF@siITGAV group was (474.5+/-34.4) pg/ml, (437.2+/-16.5) pg/ml, and (388.4+/-14.4) pg/ml, respectively. MOF@siITGAV could better penetrate into 4T1 spheroids and exhibit no obvious toxicity. The cell viability was (99.7+/-3.5)%, (98.2+/-5.2)%, (97.3+/-6.6)%, (92.1+/-8.1)%, and (92.4+/-4.1)%, respectively, after MOF@siITGAV treatment with the concentration of 0, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 mug/ml, respectively, for 24 h. The tumor growth in the MOF@siITGAV group was suppressed significantly. After 15-day treatment, the tumor volume of the MOF@siITGAV group was (135.3+/-41.9) mm(3), smaller than that of the blank control group [(691.1+/-193.0) mm(3)] (P=0.025). The expression of collagen and the number of CD8 positive cells of the MOF@siITGAV group were lower than those of the other two groups. No significant abnormalities were observed in the main organs of mice. Conclusions: Targeting the integrinalphav on the surface of cancer cells could destroy extracellular matrix, improve drug delivery, and increase immune infiltration.

    Title: [Multi-omics prediction of lymph node metastasis status in breast cancer].
    Authors: Jin Y, Wang W, Li JB
    Abstract: Lymph node metastasis status stands as a pivotal prognostic indicator in forecasting the outlook for breast cancer patients. Consequently, precise evaluation of this status holds paramount importance in the staging, treatment, and prognosis of breast cancer. The utilization of radiomics, genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and histopathology methodologies has notably enhanced the precision of lymph node metastasis status prediction in breast cancer. This review provides an overview of recent advancements in omics-based lymph node metastasis prediction for breast cancer, elucidating the significance of various omics prediction models and integrated multi-omics models in this predictive endeavor. The overarching goal is to augment the accuracy of preoperative lymph node metastasis status prediction in breast cancer, thereby aiding clinicians in the selection of efficacious personalized treatment strategies, while concurrently averting undertreatment of patients with a heightened risk of metastasis.

    Title: [Controversy and boundary in the diagnose and treatment of thyroid cancer].
    Authors: Hu QY, Yang LC, Huang T
    Abstract: In recent years, the incidence of thyroid cancer has rapidly increased, whereas the mortality rate has not risen correspondingly. Therefore, scholars at home and abroad have proposed the view of overdiagnosis in thyroid cancer, sparking intense debates about the phenomenon of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. A historical review and discussion of the primary reasons for the increase in thyroid cancer incidence and the improvement in treatment outcomes are beneficial. It helps clarify that the real increase in thyroid cancer is primarily due to the higher incidence rate, rather than overdiagnosis. Additionally, it allows us to reevaluate which factors guarantee favorable efficacy in thyroid cancer.

    Title: Neoadjuvant radiotherapy in ER(+), HER2(+), and triple-negative -specific breast cancer based humanized tumor mice enhances anti-PD-L1 treatment efficacy.
    Authors: Bruss C, Albert V, Seitz S, Blaimer S, Kellner K, Pohl F, Ortmann O, Brockhoff G, Wege AK
    Abstract: Pre-operative radiation therapy is not currently integrated into the treatment protocols for breast cancer. However, transforming immunological "cold" breast cancers by neoadjuvant irradiation into their "hot" variants is supposed to elicit an endogenous tumor immune defense and, thus, enhance immunotherapy efficiency. We investigated cellular and immunological effects of sub-lethal, neoadjuvant irradiation of ER pos., HER2 pos., and triple-negative breast cancer subtypes in-vitro and in-vivo in humanized tumor mice (HTM). This mouse model is characterized by a human-like immune system and therefore facilitates detailed analysis of the mechanisms and efficiency of neoadjuvant, irradiation-induced "in-situ vaccination", especially in the context of concurrently applied checkpoint therapy. Similar to clinical appearances, we observed a gradually increased immunogenicity from the luminal over the HER2-pos. to the triple negative subtype in HTM indicated by an increasing immune cell infiltration into the tumor tissue. Anti-PD-L1 therapy divided the HER2-pos. and triple negative HTM groups into responder and non-responder, while the luminal HTMs were basically irresponsive. Irradiation alone was effective in the HER2-pos. and luminal subtype-specific HTM and was supportive for overcoming irresponsiveness to single anti-PD-L1 treatment. The treatment success correlated with a significantly increased T cell proportion and PD-1 expression in the spleen. In all subtype-specific HTM combination therapy proved most effective in diminishing tumor growth, enhancing the immune response, and converted non-responder into responder during anti-PD-L1 therapy. In HTM, neoadjuvant irradiation reinforced anti-PD-L1 checkpoint treatment of breast cancer in a subtype -specific manner. According to the "bench to bedside" principle, this study offers a vital foundation for clinical translating the use of neoadjuvant irradiation in the context of checkpoint therapy.

    Title: Comparison Between Erector Spinae Plane Block versus Serratus Anterior Plane Block Regarding Analgesia and Stress Response After Modified Radical Mastectomy: Randomized Controlled Trial.
    Authors: Abd Elmohsen Bedewy A, Mohamed MS, Sultan HM, Khalil MS
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Modified radical mastectomy (MRM) is the primary surgical treatment for breast cancer, yet it leads to significant postoperative pain. OBJECTIVES: This randomized controlled trial evaluates the effects of an erector spinae plane block (ESPB) versus a serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) on post-MRM pain management and stress response reduction. METHODS: Sixty individuals scheduled for unilateral MRM under general anesthesia from October 2021 to October 2022 were divided into three groups. Group A comprised 20 patients who received ultrasound-guided ESPB (20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine). Group B included 20 patients who received ultrasound-guided SAPB (20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine). Group C was treated with intravenous morphine based on pain scores. Anesthesia was induced using 2 mug/kg of fentanyl and 2 - 3 mg/kg of propofol. The study compared the three groups regarding pain scores using a numerical rating scale, serum cortisol levels, total fentanyl, and morphine consumption, changes in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) during surgery, and the occurrence of postoperative complications. RESULTS: Statistically significant reductions in pain scores were observed in group A compared to groups B and C. Moreover, group A exhibited a significant decrease in postoperative morphine consumption, serum cortisol levels 1 hour post-surgery (P = 0.021), MAP, and postoperative vomiting and nausea compared to group B. Furthermore, groups A and B showed statistically significant improvements in all parameters compared to group C. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that ESPB provides superior analgesic effects compared to SAPB in patients undergoing MRM, with reduced morphine use and lower postoperative cortisol levels. Both blocks offer more effective pain control than intravenous morphine alone.

    Abstract: FOXK2, a member of the Forkhead box K (FOXK) transcription factor family, is widely expressed in various tissues and organs throughout the body. FOXK2 plays crucial roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, autophagy, de novo nucleotide biosynthesis, DNA damage response, and aerobic glycolysis. Although FOXK2 is recognized as an oncogene in colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, it acts as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer, cervical cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This review provides an overview of the recent progress in understanding the regulatory mechanisms of FOXK2 and its downstream targets, highlights the significant impact of FOXK2 dysregulation on cancer etiology, and discusses the potential of targeting FOXK2 for cancer treatment.

    Title: Visual analysis of the research frontiers, hotspots and trends of exercise therapy intervention in tumor-related sleep-wake disorders.
    Authors: Han J, Zhang J, Zhang L, Guo J, Peng X, Ying C, Li Z, Li M, Chang L, Zhang Y
    Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To systematically understand the research frontiers, hotspots and development trends of exercise therapy in the intervention of tumor-related sleep-wake disorders, and to provide scientific basis for follow-up research. METHODS: Downloaded the original research papers on February 26, 2024, from the Web of Science core collection database, on tumor-associated sleep-wake disorders. The data that met the inclusion criteria were imported into the Bibliometric Analysis Platform (http://biblimetric.com), CiteSpace 6.3.R1 and VOSviwer1.6.20 software for visual analysis, and imported into Excel2021. Scientometric analysis was performed with Oringin2021 and PyCharm Community Edition 2022.1.3. RESULTS: A total of 512 original research papers on tumor-related sleep-wake disorders were obtained. The most influential countries in the subject area are the United States, Spain and German, the institutions are the University of California System, Sun Yat Sen University and Northwestern University, et al., the authors are Berger AM, Aaronson NK, Bower JE, et al., and the journals are Cancer, Brit J Cancer and Cancer Nurs. The co-cited references suggest that the current research frontier in the field mainly involves the level, place and program of exercise therapy, including the relationship between physical activity, sedentary behavior and cancer prevention and control. The results of co-occurrence keyword network analysis showed that quality of life, physical activity, breast cancer, exercise, fatigue, and survivors may be the research hotspots in this field, with breast cancer, health, aerobic exercise, adults, and chemotherapy being the most popular. CONCLUSIONS: The number of papers published and the research enthusiasm in this field show a steady upward trend. However, there is a lack of influential institutions and scholars, and there is relatively little research collaboration across countries/regions/institutions. The scientific research influence of institutions and scholars in most European and American countries/regions is significantly ahead of that of institutions and scholars in Asian and African countries/regions. But Sun Yat Sen University in China is a relatively active and influential scientific research institution in recent years, which is worthy of attention. In addition, the research frontier of this discipline is the level, place and program of exercise therapy auxiliary intervention, and the research hotspots involve breast cancer, health, aerobic exercise, adults, chemotherapy, et al. Their clinical efficacy needs to be further demonstrated in multi-center, large-sample and high-quality prospective studies.

    Title: Is there any radiation-induced brachial plexopathy after hypofractionated postmastectomy radiotherapy with helical tomotherapy?
    Authors: Chomchai T, Klunklin P, Tongprasert S, Kanthawang T, Toapichattrakul P, Chitapanarux I
    Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Radiation-induced brachial plexopathy (RIBP) is one of the most concerning late radiation effects after hypofractionated postmastectomy radiotherapy (HF-PMRT) to the chest wall and regional lymph nodes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the RIBP events occurring in breast cancer patients after HF-PMRT using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) by helical tomotherapy. Furthermore, the dosimetric parameters of the ipsilateral brachial plexus were reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Breast cancer patients who underwent HF-PMRT using the IMRT via HT at our institute were included. In the first cohort, subjective RIBP symptoms were measured using a QuickDASH questionnaire, whereas objective RIBP events were assessed using a comprehensive physical evaluation in the second cohort. The ipsilateral brachial plexus from all eligible patients' treatment plans was contoured, and the dosimetric parameters were explored. RESULTS: From March 2014 to December 2022, 229 patients were enrolled; 107 and 72 individuals were in the first and second cohorts, respectively. The first cohort's median follow-up period was 27 months, and the second cohort was 31 months. In the first cohort, 80 patients (74.77%) had a normal function, 21 (19.63%) had a mild grade, and 6 (5.61%) had a moderate grade; no severe or very severe RIBP was observed. However, the comprehensive physical evaluation of the second cohort indicated no RIBP events. Dosimetric analysis revealed that the median maximum dose was 44.52, 44.52, and 44.60 Gy; the median mean dose was 33.00, 32.23, and 32.33 Gy; and the median dose at 0.03 cc was 44.33, 44.36, and 44.39 Gy for all patients, patients in the first and second cohort, respectively. Each dosimetric parameter was evaluated, and no statistically significant differences were detected. CONCLUSION: The absence of RIBP events supports the safety of employing HF-PMRT by HT for the chest wall and all regional lymph nodes. We propose that applying the ICRU Report 83 criteria for IMRT planning, which limit the maximum dose (107% of the prescribed dose) to less than 2% of the planning target volume and exclude the brachial plexus region from the maximal dose area, is a practical way to minimize the risk of RIBP from HF-PMRT.

    Title: Untypical bilateral breast cancer with peritoneal fibrosis on (18)F-FDG PET/CT: case report and literature review.
    Authors: Song L, Qiu Y, Huang W, Sun X, Yang Q, Peng Y, Kang L
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Retroperitoneal fibrosis, a condition of uncertain origin, is rarely linked to 8% of malignant cases, including breast, lung, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, thyroid, and carcinoid. The mechanism leading to peritoneal fibrosis induced by tumors is not well understood, possibly encompassing direct infiltration of neoplastic cells or the initiation of inflammatory responses prompted by cytokines released by tumor cells. We report a case of breast cancer with renal metastasis and retroperitoneal fibrosis detected using (18)F-FDG PET/CT, providing help for clinical diagnosis and treatment. CASE REPORT: A 49-year-old woman was referred to the hospital with elevated creatinine and oliguria for over a month. Abdominal computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a retroperitoneal fibrosis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) was suspected. However, a percutaneous biopsy of the kidney lesion confirmed metastasis from breast cancer. The physical examination revealed inverted nipples and an orange peel appearance on the skin of both breasts. Ultrasonography revealed bilateral hyperplasia (BIRADS 4a) of the mammary glands and bilateral neck and axillary lymphadenopathy. Subsequently, (18)F-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computer tomography ((18)F-FDG PET/CT) detected abnormally high uptake (SUVmax) in the bilateral mammary glands and axillary lymph nodes, suggesting bilateral breast cancer. Furthermore, abnormal (18)F-FDG uptake was detected in the kidney, suggesting renal metastasis. In addition, abnormal (18)F-FDG uptake was observed in the vertebrae, accompanied by an elevation in inhomogeneous bone mineral density, raising suspicion of bone metastases. However, the possibility of myelodysplasia cannot be dismissed, and further investigations will be conducted during close follow-ups. There was significant (18)F-FDG uptake in the retroperitoneal position indicating a potential association between retroperitoneal fibrosis and breast cancer. The final pathological diagnosis of the breast tissue confirmed bilateral invasive ductal carcinoma. The patient had been treated with 11 cycles of albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel (0.3 mg) and had no significant adverse reaction. CONCLUSION: In this case, neither the bilateral breast cancer nor the kidney metastatic lesion showed typical nodules or masses, so breast ultrasound, abdominal CT, and MRI did not suggest malignant lesions. PET/CT played an important role in detecting occult metastases and primary lesions, thereby contributing to more accurate staging, monitoring treatment responses, and prediction of prognosis in breast cancer.

    Title: Efficacy and safety of Trastuzumab Emtansine in treating human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive metastatic breast cancer in Chinese population: a real-world multicenter study.
    Authors: He M, Zhao W, Wang P, Li W, Chen H, Yuan Z, Pan G, Gao H, Sun L, Chu J, Li L, Hu Y
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) has been approved worldwide for treating metastatic breast cancer (mBC) in patients who have received first-line therapy, shown disease progression, and are human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive. T-DM1 received approval in China to treat early-stage breast cancer (BC) in 2020 and for mBC in 2021. In March 2023, T-DM1 was included in medical insurance coverage, significantly expanding the eligible population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This post-marketing observational study aimed to assess the safety and effectiveness of T-DM1 in real-world clinical practice in China. This study enrolled 31 individuals with HER2-positive early-stage BC and 70 individuals with HER2-positive advanced BC from 8 study centers in Shandong Province, China. The T-DM1 dosage was 3.6 mg/kg injected intravenously every 3 weeks until the disease advanced or the drug toxicity became uncontrollable, whichever occurred earlier. Additionally, efficacy and safety information on T-DM1 were collected. RESULTS: During the 7-month follow-up period, no recurrence or metastases were observed in patients who had early-stage BC. The disease control rate was 31.43% (22/70) in patients with advanced BC. The most common adverse effect of T-DM1 was thrombocytopenia, with an incidence of 69.31% (70/101), and the probability of Grade >/= 3 thrombocytopenia was 11.88% (12/101). CONCLUSION: This real-world study demonstrated that T-DM1 had good efficacy and was well tolerated by both HER2-positive early-stage BC and mBC patients.

    Title: Incidence and Prognostic Significance of Androgen Receptors (AR) in Indian Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC).
    Authors: Mishra A, Mishra SK, Sharanappa V, Krishnani N, Kumari N, Agarwal G
    Abstract: Molecular sub-characterization of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has great therapeutic and possibly prognostic implications. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of luminal androgen receptor (LAR) subtype of TNBC and secondary aims were sub-categorization and clinico-pathologic correlation of LAR breast cancers. Retrospective study (January 2008 and 31st of December 2018) consisting of 157 TNBC patients. Androgen receptor (AR) expression was measured by immunohistochemical analysis. One percent cutoff was set as a positive expression. Sub-categorization was done on the basis of EGFR (> 15% of tumor cells) and Ki-67 expression (low- < 11%, intermediate- 11-20%, and high- > 21%). AR expression was correlated with various clinico-pathologic features and outcomes of the patients. The incidence of AR expression in TNBC was 24.8%. Considering different thresholds of > 5%, > 10%, and > 20% immunostaining, the incidence of AR positivity was 18.4, 15.2, and 11.5% respectively. The incidence of Ki-67 (p = 0.89) and EGFR (p = 0.643) expression did not differ significantly in AR-positive and -negative TNBC. Based on EGFR expression 19, 67 and 14% patients were categorized as low, intermediate, and high risk respectively. Low-risk (p </= 0.001) and low-grade (p = 0.014) tumors were more likely to have > 10% AR expression. Clinico-pathological profile, response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, disease-free survival (p = 0.458), and overall survival (p = 0.806) did not significantly differ between AR expressing and negative TNBC. On multivariate analysis, only tumor staging was a significant predictor of survival (p = 0.012) and AR expression of > 10% revealed a trend towards improved survival (p = 0.07). When considering only AR-positive TNBC, AR expression of > 10% (p = 0.038), distant metastases (p = 0.003), and EGFR status (p = 0.024) were significantly associated with survival. AR expression does not seem to very strongly correlate with prognosis in TNBC and further studies could focus more on its predictive role in deciding anti-androgen therapy.

    Title: Evaluation of Histomorphological Changes in Breast Cancer Post-Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy.
    Authors: Ahuja S, G K, Zaheer S
    Abstract: Breast cancer, a leading cause of global female mortality, demands comprehensive diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. This study delves into the nuanced realm of post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy breast cancer specimens, emphasizing the imperative need for pathologists to discern stromal and nuclear alterations adeptly. The investigation, encompassing 100 female patients with a mean age of 47.5 years, elucidates the demographic and clinicopathological parameters. Predominantly presenting as palpable lumps (85%), invasive ductal carcinoma emerged as the predominant histological type (98%). The primary focus of the study revolves around the morphological changes post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with a meticulous qualitative analysis encompassing stromal elements (fibrosis, elastosis, calcification) and nuclear features (pyknosis, hyperchromasia). Notably, the response to chemotherapy, classified by the International Union against Cancer criteria, delineates a substantial pathological complete response (55%), partial response (35%), and limited non-response (10%). The therapeutic landscape includes a majority of cases undergoing extensive chemotherapy cycles, primarily featuring the cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel regimen. Remarkably, this investigation unveils fibrosis (63%) and elastosis/collagenization (51%) as prevalent stromal changes, while pyknosis (58%) and hyperchromasia (48%) dominate nuclear alterations. In conclusion, this retrospective study provides a comprehensive overview of post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy breast cancer specimens, shedding light on the intricate interplay of clinical parameters, treatment responses, and histopathological changes. The findings underscore the pivotal role of pathologists in accurately diagnosing and grading tumors in the evolving landscape of breast cancer management.

    Title: Prospective Study to Evaluate Efficacy of Single Versus Double Drains in Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Surgery.
    Authors: Roy S, Gupta SS, Singh U, Anand R, Bhat G, Sooraj R, Raam M, Aswinee R, Ramakant P, Singh KR, Misra AK
    Abstract: Seroma formation is a common sequel following modified radical mastectomy (MRM), which hinders healing, may prolong hospital stay, and cause a delay in adjuvant treatment. Closed suction drains have been used to prevent formation of seroma; however, the use of a single drain in the axilla along with draining the mastectomy flaps and axilla separately remains a topic of debate. This prospective randomized dual-arm study was conducted in the Department of Endocrine Surgery. All female patients with carcinoma breast diagnosed on core tissue biopsy, undergoing modified radical mastectomy, upfront or post neoadjuvant systemic therapy were included. Patients were randomized into two groups. In the first group, a single drain was placed in the axilla whereas in the second group, a drain each was placed below the mastectomy flaps and the axilla. Patients' particulars and the weight of the mass excised along with the operative details were documented. The volume of the drain was recorded daily. The flap drain was removed on postoperative day 5 and the axillary drain was removed when the drain volume was less than 30 mL/24 h for 2 consecutive days. The period of drain placement, volume of drainage, volume of seroma (if formed), and other complications (if any) were recorded. Patients in the single drain group had a significantly earlier drain removal time as compared to those with double drains (p = 0.01). The number of patients in whom seroma formation had occurred was more in the double drain group, but the difference was not significant. The average volume of aspirated seroma fluid was insignificantly more in the single drain group. The only other complication noticed was flap necrosis-in 5% patients of the double drain group. Total volume of drainage (p < 0.0001) and type of drain (p = 0.0208) were associated with higher rates of seroma formation, whereas BMI (p = 0.0516), weight of excised breast mass (p = 0.407), and age (p = 0.6379) were not associated with the rate of seroma formation. Outcomes in terms of drain volume or seroma formation were statistically indifferent between the two groups. Still, use of only a single axillary drain should be promoted, keeping in mind the earlier drain removal period, better patient compliance, and reduced hospital stay.

    Title: Menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: a population-based cohort study of 1.3 million women in Norway.
    Authors: Stoer NC, Vangen S, Singh D, Fortner RT, Hofvind S, Ursin G, Botteri E
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: It is important to monitor the association between menopausal hormone therapy (HT) use and breast cancer (BC) risk with contemporary estimates, and specifically focus on HT types and new drugs. METHODS: We estimated hazard ratios (HR) of BC risk according to HT type, administration route and individual drugs, overall and stratified by body mass index (BMI), molecular subtype and detection mode, with non-HT use as reference. RESULTS: We included 1,275,783 women, 45+ years, followed from 2004, for a median of 12.7 years. Oral oestrogen combined with daily progestin was associated with the highest risk of BC (HR 2.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.31-2.54), with drug-specific HRs ranging from Cliovelle(R): 1.63 (95% CI 1.35-1.96) to Kliogest(R): 2.67 (2.37-3.00). Vaginal oestradiol was not associated with BC risk. HT use was more strongly associated with luminal A cancer (HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.86-2.09) than other molecular subtypes, and more strongly with interval (HR 2.00, 95% CI: 1.83-2.30) than screen-detected (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.26-1.41) BC in women 50-71 years. HRs for HT use decreased with increasing BMI. CONCLUSIONS: The use of oral and transdermal HT was associated with an increased risk of BC. The associations varied according to HT type, individual drugs, molecular subtype, detection mode and BMI.

    Title: Metabolism-driven in vitro/in vivo disconnect of an oral ERa VHL-PROTAC.

    Abstract: Targeting the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) pathway is validated in the clinic as an effective means to treat ER+ breast cancers. Here we present the development of a VHL-targeting and orally bioavailable proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) degrader of ERalpha. In vitro studies with this PROTAC demonstrate excellent ERalpha degradation and ER antagonism in ER+ breast cancer cell lines. However, upon dosing the compound in vivo we observe an in vitro-in vivo disconnect. ERalpha degradation is lower in vivo than expected based on the in vitro data. Investigation into potential causes for the reduced maximal degradation reveals that metabolic instability of the PROTAC linker generates metabolites that compete for binding to ERalpha with the full PROTAC, limiting degradation. This observation highlights the requirement for metabolically stable PROTACs to ensure maximal efficacy and thus optimisation of the linker should be a key consideration when designing PROTACs.

    Title: The incidence of brain metastases in breast cancer according to molecular subtype and stage: a 10-year single institution analysis.
    Authors: Poletes C, Amanirad B, Santiago AT, Yan M, Conrad T, Jerzak KJ, Shultz DB
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is the second most common etiology of brain metastases (BrM). We aimed to examine the incidence of BrM among all BC patients presenting to a large tertiary cancer centre over one decade. METHODS: We included all BC patients presenting consecutively between 2009 and 2019 and cross referenced that cohort to a radiotherapy database, identifying patients treated for BrM at any time following their initial presentation. Cumulative incidences (CI) of BrM diagnoses were calculated using death as a competing risk and compared using the Fine-Gray method. Overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan Meier method. RESULTS: We identified 12,995 unique patients. The CI of BrM in patients who initially presented with Stage 0-4 disease was 2.1%, 3.7%, 9.4%, 10.6%, and 28.7%, respectively at 10 years. For 8,951 patients with available molecular subtype data, 6,470 (72%), 961 (11%), 1,023 (11%), and 497 (6%) had hormone-receptor (HR)-positive/ERBB2-, HR-negative/ERBB2-, HR-positive/ERBB2 + , and HR-negative/ERBB2 + disease, respectively; the CI of BrM in each was 7.6%, 25.3%, 24.1%, and 26.6%, at 10 years following BC diagnosis, respectively. Median overall survival (OS) following BC diagnosis and BrM diagnosis was 28 years 95% CI [25, 32] and 10 months 95% CI [9, 12], respectively. CONCLUSIONS: From a large, registry-based study, we observed that patients with ERBB2 + and triple negative BC have the highest incidence of BrM. Our data supports prospective surveillance brain MRI studies. Given advancements in BrM treatment, clinicians should have a low threshold for brain imaging in BC patients with high risk subtypes.

    Title: Predictive analysis of breast cancer response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy through plasma metabolomics.
    Authors: Yamada M, Jinno H, Naruse S, Isono Y, Maeda Y, Sato A, Matsumoto A, Ikeda T, Sugimoto M
    Abstract: PURPOSE: Preoperative chemotherapy is a critical component of breast cancer management, yet its effectiveness is not uniform. Moreover, the adverse effects associated with chemotherapy necessitate the identification of a patient subgroup that would derive the maximum benefit from this treatment. This study aimed to establish a method for predicting the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients utilizing a metabolomic approach. METHODS: Plasma samples were obtained from 87 breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy at our facility, collected both before the commencement of the treatment and before the second treatment cycle. Metabolite analysis was conducted using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). We performed comparative profiling of metabolite concentrations by assessing the metabolite profiles of patients who achieved a pathological complete response (pCR) against those who did not, both in initial and subsequent treatment cycles. RESULTS: Significant variances were observed in the metabolite profiles between pCR and non-pCR cases, both at the onset of preoperative chemotherapy and before the second cycle. Noteworthy distinctions were also evident between the metabolite profiles from the initial and the second neoadjuvant chemotherapy courses. Furthermore, metabolite profiles exhibited variations associated with intrinsic subtypes at all assessed time points. CONCLUSION: The application of plasma metabolomics, utilizing CE-MS and LC-MS, may serve as a tool for predicting the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer in the future after all necessary validations have been completed.

    Title: Longitudinal assessment of real-world patient adherence: a 12-month electronic patient-reported outcomes follow-up of women with early breast cancer undergoing treatment.
    Authors: Gebert P, Hage AM, Blohmer JU, Roehle R, Karsten MM
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) assess patients' health status and quality of life, improving patient care and treatment effects, yet little is known about their use and adherence in routine patient care. AIMS: We evaluated the adherence of invasive breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) patients to ePROs follow-up and whether specific patient characteristics are related to longitudinal non-adherence. METHODS: Since November 2016, the Breast Center at Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin has implemented an ongoing prospective PRO routine program, requiring patients to complete ePROs assessments and consent to email-based follow-up in the first 12 months after therapy starts. Frequencies and summary statistics are presented. Multiple logistic regression models were performed to determine an association between patient characteristics and non-adherence. RESULTS: Out of 578 patients, 239 patients (41.3%, 95%CI: 37.3-45.5%) completed baseline assessment and all five ePROs follow-up during the first 12 months after therapy. On average, above 70% of those patients responded to the ePROs follow-up assessment. Adherence to the ePROs follow-up was higher during the COVID-19 pandemic than in the time periods before (47.4% (111/234) vs. 33.6% (71/211)). Factors associated with longitudinal non-adherence were younger age, a higher number of comorbidities, no chemotherapy, and a low physical functioning score in the EORTC QLQ-C30 at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: The study reveals moderate adherence to 12-month ePROs follow-up assessments in invasive early breast cancer and DCIS patients, with response rates ranging from 60 to 80%. Emphasizing the benefits for young patients and those with high disease burdens might further increase adherence.

    Title: Joint EANM-SNMMI guideline on the role of 2-[(18)F]FDG PET/CT in no special type breast cancer : (endorsed by the ACR, ESSO, ESTRO, EUSOBI/ESR, and EUSOMA).
    Authors: Vaz SC, Woll JPP, Cardoso F, Groheux D, Cook GJR, Ulaner GA, Jacene H, Rubio IT, Schoones JW, Peeters MV, Poortmans P, Mann RM, Graff SL, Dibble EH, de Geus-Oei LF
    Abstract: INTRODUCTION: There is much literature about the role of 2-[(18)F]FDG PET/CT in patients with breast cancer (BC). However, there exists no international guideline with involvement of the nuclear medicine societies about this subject. PURPOSE: To provide an organized, international, state-of-the-art, and multidisciplinary guideline, led by experts of two nuclear medicine societies (EANM and SNMMI) and representation of important societies in the field of BC (ACR, ESSO, ESTRO, EUSOBI/ESR, and EUSOMA). METHODS: Literature review and expert discussion were performed with the aim of collecting updated information regarding the role of 2-[(18)F]FDG PET/CT in patients with no special type (NST) BC and summarizing its indications according to scientific evidence. Recommendations were scored according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) criteria. RESULTS: Quantitative PET features (SUV, MTV, TLG) are valuable prognostic parameters. In baseline staging, 2-[(18)F]FDG PET/CT plays a role from stage IIB through stage IV. When assessing response to therapy, 2-[(18)F]FDG PET/CT should be performed on certified scanners, and reported either according to PERCIST, EORTC PET, or EANM immunotherapy response criteria, as appropriate. 2-[(18)F]FDG PET/CT may be useful to assess early metabolic response, particularly in non-metastatic triple-negative and HER2+ tumours. 2-[(18)F]FDG PET/CT is useful to detect the site and extent of recurrence when conventional imaging methods are equivocal and when there is clinical and/or laboratorial suspicion of relapse. Recent developments are promising. CONCLUSION: 2-[(18)F]FDG PET/CT is extremely useful in BC management, as supported by extensive evidence of its utility compared to other imaging modalities in several clinical scenarios.

    Title: Nanoencapsulation of Extracts and Isolated Compounds of Plant Origin and Their Cytotoxic Effects on Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatments: Advantages and New Challenges.
    Authors: Guillen-Melendez GA, Perez-Hernandez RA, Chavez-Montes A, Castillo-Velazquez U, de Jesus Loera-Arias M, Montes-de-Oca-Saucedo CR, Rodriguez-Rocha H, Contreras-Torres FF, Saucedo-Cardenas O, Soto-Dominguez A
    Abstract: This review analyzes the current progress in loaded nanoparticles (NPs) of plant extracts or isolated antineoplastic compounds used in breast and cervical cancer treatments. Also, it provides a comprehensive overview of the contributions made by traditional medicine and nanomedicine to the research of two of the most prevalent types of cancer in women worldwide: breast and cervical cancer. Searches were conducted in electronic databases to gather relevant information related to the biological activity of the NPs, which were meticulously reviewed. Nanomedicine has advanced to incorporate plant compounds including their crude extracts, in the preparation of NPs. The most used method is green synthesis, whose most outstanding advantages, is the reduced preparation time, and the variety of results that can be obtained depending on the reaction times, pH, temperature, and concentration of both the bio-reducing agent and the compound or plant extract. Most of the studies focus on evaluating crude extracts with high polarity, such as aqueous, alcoholic, and hydroalcoholic extracts. In conclusion, exploring the use of organic compounds is considered an area of opportunity for further research and future perspectives. Most of the analyzed studies were conducted using in vitro assays, highlighting the relatively recent nature of this field. It is expected that future research will involve more in vivo assays, particularly focusing on isolated cell lines representing the most difficult-to-treat types of cancer, such as triple-negative breast cancer like MDA-MB-231. Notably the MCF-7 cell line is one of the most used, while limited studies were found concerning cervical cancer.

    Authors: Wang M, Chen G, Hu B, Zhang F, Xu Q, Li L, Xi Q, Liu J, Yu Z, Cao P, Wang Y, Yu M
    Abstract: The low oxidation level and immunosuppressive microenvironment within hypoxic tumor tissue are critical factors contributing to the inefficacy of various anti-tumor strategies. Herein, we have designed a novel intravenous injection nanoplatform to conduct electro-immunotherapy, based on phospholipid-modified PtPd nanocrystals loaded with the immunoregulator IPI549 (LP@Pt-Pd@IPI549 nanoparticles, LPPI). LPPI responds to reactive oxygen species (ROS), triggering a cascade of therapeutic effects that overcome hypoxia-related resistance and effectively eradicate hypoxic tumors. Firstly, under electric field exposure, LPPI relied on water rather than oxygen to generate abundant ROS under hypoxic conditions for tumor electrodynamic therapy (EDT). Moreover, the generated ROS further induced the disintegration of the outer phospholipid membrane of LPPI, leading to the release of the immunoregulator and inhibition of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), triggering cascade immune responses. Additionally, the immunomodulatory effects of IPI549, in synergy with the immunogenic cell death (ICD) induced by EDT, reversed the immunosuppressive microenvironment contributing to tumor resistance. In summary, EDT transiently killed tumor cells while simultaneously generating antigen release, instigating an adaptive immune response for electro-immunotherapy, resulting in a potent and long-lasting tumor inhibition effect.

    Title: PROTAC: novel degradable approach for different targets to treat breast cancer.
    Authors: Wang Z, Che S, Yu Z
    Abstract: The revolutionary Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTACs) have the exciting potential to reshape the pharmaceutical industry landscape by leveraging the ubiquitin-proteasome system for targeted protein degradation. Breast cancer, the most prevalent cancer in women, could be treated using PROTAC therapy. Although substantial work has been conducted, there isn't yet a comprehensive overview or progress update on PROTAC therapy for breast cancer. Hence, in this article, we've compiled recent research progress focusing on different breast cancer target proteins, such as estrogen receptor (ER), BET, CDK, HER2, PARP, EZH2, etc. This resource aims to serve as a guide for future PROTAC-based breast cancer treatment design.

    Title: HER2 siRNA Facilitated Gene Silencing Coupled with Doxorubicin Delivery: A Dual Responsive Nanoplatform Abrogates Breast Cancer.
    Authors: M G A, K S A, B S U, P L R, H P S, J S, Joseph MM, T T S
    Abstract: The present study investigated the concurrent delivery of antineoplastic drug, doxorubicin, and HER2 siRNA through a targeted theranostic metallic gold nanoparticle designed using polysaccharide, PSP001. The as-synthesized HsiRNA@PGD NPs were characterized in terms of structural, functional, physicochemical, and biological properties. HsiRNA@PGD NPs exposed adequate hydrodynamic size, considerable zeta potential, and excellent drug/siRNA loading and encapsulation efficiency. Meticulous exploration of the biocompatible dual-targeted nanoconjugate exhibited an appealing biocompatibility and pH-sensitive cargo release kinetics, indicating its safety for use in clinics. HsiRNA@PGD NPs deciphered competent cancer cell internalization, enhanced cytotoxicity mediated via the induction of apoptosis, and excellent downregulation of the overexpressing target HER2 gene. Further in vivo explorations in the SKBR3 xenograft breast tumor model revealed the appealing tumor reduction properties, selective accumulation in the tumor site followed by significant suppression of the HER2 gene which contributed to the exclusive abrogation of breast tumor mass by the HsiRNA@PGD NPs. Compared to free drugs or the monotherapy constructs, the dual delivery approach produced a synergistic suppression of breast tumors both in vitro and in vivo. Hence the drawings from these findings implicate that the as-synthesized HsiRNA@PGD NPs could offer a promising platform for chemo-RNAi combinational breast cancer therapy.

    Title: NIR-Responsive Methotrexate-Modified Iron Selenide Nanorods for Synergistic Magnetic Hyperthermic, Photothermal, and Chemodynamic Therapy.
    Authors: Thirumurugan S, Muthiah KS, Lin YC, Dhawan U, Liu WC, Wang AN, Liu X, Hsiao M, Tseng CL, Chung RJ
    Abstract: Breast cancer is a malignant tumor with a high mortality rate among women. Therefore, it is necessary to develop novel therapies to effectively treat this disease. In this study, iron selenide nanorods (FeSe(2) NRs) were designed for use in magnetic hyperthermic, photothermal, and chemodynamic therapy (MHT/PTT/CDT) for breast cancer. To illustrate their efficacy, FeSe(2) NRs were modified with the chemotherapeutic agent methotrexate (MTX). MTX-modified FeSe(2) (FeSe(2)-MTX) exhibited excellent controlled drug release properties. Fe(2+) released from FeSe(2) NRs induced the release of (*)OH from H(2)O(2) via a Fenton/Fenton-like reaction, enhancing the efficacy of CDT. Under alternating magnetic field (AMF) stimulation and 808 nm laser irradiation, FeSe(2)-MTX exerted potent hyperthermic and photothermal effects by suppressing tumor growth in a breast cancer nude mouse model. In addition, FeSe(2) NRs can be used for magnetic resonance imaging in vivo by incorporating their superparamagnetic characteristics into a single nanomaterial. Overall, we presented a novel technique for the precise delivery of functional nanosystems to tumors that can enhance the efficacy of breast cancer treatment.

    Title: Increasing inclusion and equity for Black women in breast cancer clinical trials.
    Authors: Taye A, Elkhanany A, Stringer-Reasor E
    Abstract: Black women diagnosed with breast cancer experience a disproportionately high mortality rate. The disparity in outcomes between Black and White women is multifactorial, with a large portion attributed to lower participation of minorities in clinical trials. The lack of diversity in clinical trials continues to both reflect and contribute to health care inequities, limiting the generalizability of research findings. In addition, women who do not enroll in clinical trials miss out on the standard-of-care or often better patient care provided in these trials. Barriers to enrolling diverse populations encompass system-, provider-, and patient-level barriers. Identifying these barriers and providing actionable solutions are key to bolstering enrollment in clinical trials and ultimately eliminating cancer disparities. This review elucidates the barriers to clinical trial participation in Black women diagnosed with breast cancer and discusses ways to overcome these challenges.

    Title: Phytochemical study of Magonia pubescens A. St.-Hil. and cytotoxicity of branches aqueous extract on breast cancer and leukemia cells.
    Authors: Moraes ARA, Siqueira EP, Kohlhoff M, Evangelista FCG, Sabino AP, Vieira Filho SA, Alcantara AFC, Duarte LP, Sousa GF
    Abstract: Magonia pubescens is a natural species from the Brazilian cerrado biome. Its fruits and seeds are used in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis, a common inflammatory skin disease. In this work, the known compounds lapachol, stigmasterol, maniladiol and scopoletin were isolated from hexane and dichloromethane extracts of M. pubescens branches. The aqueous extract of this material was fractioned through a liquid-liquid partition and the obtained fractions were analyzed by UHPLC-MS/MS. The results obtained were compared with data from three databases, leading to the putative identification of 51 compounds from different classes, including flavonoids, saponins and triterpenes. The cytotoxicity of aqueous fractions was assayed against breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) and leukemia (THP-1 and K562) cells. The best activity was observed for fraction AE3 against MDA-MB-231 cells (IC(50) 30.72 microg.mL(-1)).

    Title: Reliability and validity of the 6-minute pegboard and ring test for functional exercise capacity in patients with breast cancer.
    Authors: Oncu H, Calik-Kutukcu E, Vardar Yagli N, Inal-Ince D, Saglam M, Unal F, Aksoy S
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Chronic pain, sensory disturbances, and lymphedema are frequent after breast cancer, leading to arm dysfunction. There is a need for objective performance-based clinical exercise tests for the upper extremity in patients with breast cancer. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity and reliability of the 6-minute pegboard and ring test (6PBRT) in breast cancer survivors. METHODS: Forty-eight women with breast cancer (mean age = 55.40 +/- 10.40 years) were included. All patients performed 6PBRT on the first day and one week later to investigate the test-retest reliability of the 6PBRT, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated. The peak workload (W(peak)) and oxygen consumption level (VO(2peak)) during the arm ergometer test were used as outcomes for the criterion validity of the 6PBRT. RESULTS: The 6PBRT showed good test - retest reliability with an ICC(1,2) value of 0.871 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.769-0.928]. The first 6PBRT score was very strongly correlated with the second test score (r = 0.866, p < .001). The 6PBRT score was significantly correlated with VO(2peak) (r = 0.634, p < .001), and W(peak) (r = 0.546, p < .001). While the 6PBRT score had less effect on VO(2peak), the determination of VO(2peak) in the model was very good (R(2) = 0.832). CONCLUSION: The 6PBRT has good test-retest reliability and is a valid test in individuals with breast cancer. These findings suggest that 6PBRT is a practical, useful, valid and reliable assessment tool for determining functional arm exercise capacity in patients with breast cancer.

    Title: Validation of Patient-Reported Outcomes in Patients With Nonmetastatic Breast Cancer Receiving Comprehensive Nodal Irradiation in the RadComp Trial.
    Authors: Hahn EA, Pugh SL, Lu HL, Vela AM, Gillespie EF, Nichols EM, Wright JL, MacDonald SM, Cahlon O, Baas C, Braunstein LZ, Fang LC, Freedman GM, Jimenez RB, Kesslering CM, Mishra MV, Mutter RW, Ohri N, Rosen LR, Urbanic JJ, Jagsi R, Mitchell SA, Bekelman JE, Cella D
    Abstract: PURPOSE: Our purpose was to evaluate the measurement properties of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures used in the ongoing RadComp pragmatic randomized clinical trial (PRCT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: The deidentified and blinded data set included 774 English-speaking female participants who completed their 6-month posttreatment assessment. Eleven PRO measures were evaluated, including the Trial Outcome Index from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B), Satisfaction with Breast Cosmetic Outcomes, the BREAST-Q, and selected Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures. PROs were measured at 3 timepoints: baseline, completion of radiation therapy (RT), and 6 months post-RT. Ten variables were used as validity anchors. Pearson or Spearman correlations were calculated between PROs and convergent validity indicators. Mean PRO differences between clinically distinct categories were compared with analysis of variance methods (known-groups validity). PRO change scores were mapped to change in other variables (sensitivity to change). RESULTS: Most correlations between PROs and validity indicators were large (>/=0.5). Mean score for Satisfaction with Breast Cosmetic Outcomes was higher (better) for those with a lumpectomy compared with those with a mastectomy (P < .001). Mean scores for the FACT-B Trial Outcome Index and for PROMIS Fatigue and Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities were better for those with good baseline performance status compared with those with poorer baseline performance status (P < .05). At completion of RT and post-RT, mean scores for Satisfaction with Breast Cosmetic Outcomes and BREAST-Q Radiation were significantly different (P < .001) across categories for all Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy -Treatment Satisfaction - General items. There were medium-sized correlations between change scores for FACT-B Trial Outcome Index, Fatigue, Anxiety, and Ability to Participate in Social Roles and change scores in the Visual Analog Scale. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer receiving radiation in the RadComp PRCT, our findings demonstrate high reliability and validity for important PRO measures, supporting their psychometric strength and usefulness to reflect the effect of RT on health-related quality of life.

    Title: Tabersonine enhances cisplatin sensitivity by modulating Aurora kinase A and suppressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition in triple-negative breast cancer.
    Authors: Chen X, Yan Y, Liu Y, Yi Q, Xu Z
    Abstract: CONTEXT: Tabersonine has been investigated for its role in modulating inflammation-associated pathways in various diseases. However, its regulatory effects on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) have not yet been fully elucidated. OBJECTIVE: This study uncovers the anticancer properties of tabersonine in TNBC cells, elucidating its role in enhancing chemosensitivity to cisplatin (CDDP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: After tabersonine (10 muM) and/or CDDP (10 muM) treatment for 48 h in BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells, cell proliferation was evaluated using the cell counting kit-8 and colony formation assays. Quantitative proteomics, online prediction tools and molecular docking analyses were used to identify potential downstream targets of tabersonine. Transwell and wound-healing assays and Western blot analysis were used to assess epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes. RESULTS: Tabersonine demonstrated inhibitory effects on TNBC cells, with IC(50) values at 48 h being 18.1 muM for BT549 and 27.0 muM for MDA-MB-231. The combined treatment of CDDP and tabersonine synergistically suppressed cell proliferation in BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Enrichment analysis revealed that the proteins differentially regulated by tabersonine were involved in EMT-related signalling pathways. This combination treatment also effectively restricted EMT-related phenotypes. Through the integration of online target prediction and proteomic analysis, Aurora kinase A (AURKA) was identified as a potential downstream target of tabersonine. AURKA expression was reduced in TNBC cells post-treatment with tabersonine. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Tabersonine significantly enhances the chemosensitivity of CDDP in TNBC cells, underscoring its potential as a promising therapeutic agent for TNBC treatment.

    Title: Quantifying Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity in a Tumor Spheroid Model: Application for Drug Discovery.
    Authors: Sturniolo I, Varoczy C, Bede AM, Hegedus C, Demeny MA, Virag L
    Abstract: Monoclonal antibody-based immunotherapy targeting tumor antigens is now a mainstay of cancer treatment. One of the clinically relevant mechanisms of action of the antibodies is antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), where the antibody binds to the cancer cells and engages the cellular component of the immune system, e.g., natural killer (NK) cells, to kill the tumor cells. The effectiveness of these therapies could be improved by identifying adjuvant compounds that increase the sensitivity of the cancer cells or the potency of the immune cells. In addition, undiscovered drug interactions in cancer patients co-medicated for previous conditions or cancer-associated symptoms may determine the success of the antibody therapy; therefore, such unwanted drug interactions need to be eliminated. With these goals in mind, we created a cancer ADCC model and describe here a simple protocol to find ADCC-modulating drugs. Since 3D models such as cancer cell spheroids are superior to 2D cultures in predicting in vivo responses of tumors to anticancer therapies, spheroid co-cultures of EGFP-expressing HER2+ JIMT-1 breast cancer cells and the NK92.CD16 cell lines were set up and induced with Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody clinically approved against HER2-positive breast cancer. JIMT-1 spheroids were allowed to form in cell-repellent U-bottom 96-well plates. On day 3, NK cells and Trastuzumab were added. The spheroids were then stained with Annexin V-Alexa 647 to measure apoptotic cell death, which was quantitated in the peripheral zone of the spheroids with an automated microscope. The applicability of our assay to identify ADCC-modulating molecules is demonstrated by showing that Sunitinib, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved by the FDA against metastatic cancer, almost completely abolishes ADCC. The generation of the spheroids and image acquisition and analysis pipelines are compatible with high-throughput screening for ADCC-modulating compounds in cancer cell spheroids.

    Title: Quality-adjusted life years for HER2-positive, early-stage breast cancer using trastuzumab-containing regimens in the context of cost-effectiveness studies: a systematic review.
    Authors: Khoirunnisa SM, Suryanegara FDA, Setiawan D, Postma MJ
    Abstract: INTRODUCTION: This study aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of economic and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive, early-stage breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab-containing regimens, by focusing on both Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). METHODS: A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases without language or publication year restrictions. Two independent reviewers screened eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed methodology and reporting quality using the Drummond checklist and Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards 2022 (CHEERS 2022), respectively. Costs were converted to US dollars (US$) for 2023 for cross-study comparison. RESULTS: Twenty-two articles, primarily from high-income countries (HICs), were included, with ICERs ranging from US$13,176/QALY to US$254,510/QALY, falling within country-specific cost-effectiveness thresholds. A notable association was observed between higher QALYs and lower ICERs, indicating a favorable cost-effectiveness and health outcome relationship. EQ-5D was the most utilized instrument for assessing health state utility values, with diverse targeted populations. CONCLUSIONS: Studies reporting higher QALYs tend to have lower ICERs, indicating a positive relationship between cost-effectiveness and health outcomes. However, challenges such as methodological heterogeneity and transparency in utility valuation persist, underscoring the need for standardized guidelines and collaborative efforts among stakeholders.

    Title: Efficacy and safety of pyrotinib combined with albumin-bound paclitaxel as first-line treatment for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer in patients previously treated with adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant trastuzumab therapy: The stage 1 results of a single-arm, phase 2 prospective clinical trial.
    Authors: Man X, Huang J, Sun S, Zhou D, Zhang B, Fang S, Zheng F, Li C, Wang X, Huang W, Wang L, He Q, Fu H, Zhang Y, Liu C, Dong L, Zhao X, Xu L, Sun X, Fan B, Song L, Zhou Z, Yu J, Li H
    Abstract: OBJECTIVE: It has been observed that the prognosis of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer has improved significantly with HER2-targeted agents. However, there is still a lack of evidence regarding first-line anti-HER2 treatment options for patients who have received adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant trastuzumab for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Besides, there are no reliable markers that can predict the efficacy of anti-HER2 treatment in these patients. METHODS: Patients who have received adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant trastuzumab for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer were enrolled. Pyrotinib plus albumin-bound paclitaxel were used as first-line treatment. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). The safety profile was also assessed. In order to explore predictive biomarkers using Olink technology, blood samples were collected dynamically. RESULTS: From December 2019 to August 2023, the first stage of the study involved 27 eligible patients. It has not yet reached the median PFS despite the median follow-up being 17.8 months. Efficacy evaluation showed that the ORR was 92.6%, and the DCR was 100%. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher included diarrhoea (29.6%), leukopenia (11.1%), neutropenia (25.9%), oral mucositis (3.7%), and hand-foot syndrome (3.7%). Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor (RET) were proteins with significant relevance to PFS in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that pyrotinib plus albumin-bound paclitaxel as a first-line treatment regimen shows good efficacy and manageable safety for patients who have received adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant trastuzumab for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Besides, a significant association was identified between the expression levels of TLR3 and RET and the PFS in patients.

    Title: Research progress on the relationship between AURKA and tumorigenesis: the neglected nuclear function of AURKA.
    Authors: Chen M, Zhu H, Li J, Luo D, Zhang J, Liu W, Wang J
    Abstract: AURKA is a threonine or serine kinase that needs to be activated by TPX2, Bora and other factors. AURKA is located on chromosome 20 and is amplified or overexpressed in many human cancers, such as breast cancer. AURKA regulates some basic cellular processes, and this regulation is realized via the phosphorylation of downstream substrates. AURKA can function in either the cytoplasm or the nucleus. It can promote the transcription and expression of oncogenes together with other transcription factors in the nucleus, including FoxM1, C-Myc, and NF-kappaB. In addition, it also sustains carcinogenic signaling, such as N-Myc and Wnt signaling. This article will focus on the role of AURKA in the nucleus and its carcinogenic characteristics that are independent of its kinase activity to provide a theoretical explanation for mechanisms of resistance to kinase inhibitors and a reference for future research on targeted inhibitors.

    Title: Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: A Narrative Review on PD-1/PD-L1 Blockade Mechanism, Efficacy, and Safety Profile in Treating Malignancy.
    Authors: Benelli ND, Brandon I, Hew KE
    Abstract: Checkpoint inhibitors have been implicated in the treatment of several cancers due to their ability to exploit the immune system's regulatory pathways. This article serves to emphasize the importance of these immunotherapeutic agents and provide further insight into their mechanisms, efficacies, and safety profiles. The main agents in question include programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Several literature sources were found to assess the use of these inhibitors in cancers involving the lung, breast, and skin. Several peer-reviewed systematic reviews and the outcomes of clinical trials are combined within this article to support the use and further investigation of these agents in treating neoplasms. Further research into these forms of therapy underscores the revolutionary advancement of oncological interventions, which is important given the rising incidence of neoplasms within populations.

    Title: A Spectrum of Chemoport-Associated Complications and Their Management in Cancer Patients.
    Authors: Sharma V, Pandey A
    Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Chemotherapy is part and parcel of the multimodality approach to cancer treatment. Chemoports are frequently used to administer chemotherapy, preventing complications associated with the use of peripheral lines. However, chemoports have their own set of complications and can be very debilitating at times. Accurate knowledge and correct technique can help prevent and manage these complications properly. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all patients who underwent chemoport insertion for chemotherapy infusion over three years between July 2020 and June 2023. The patient's profile, type of cancer, the technique of chemoport insertion, complications related to chemoport, and its management were recorded retrospectively from patient records. RESULTS: The total number of patients in our study was 119. The age group of patients ranged from 13 years to 76 years. Of the 119 patients, 55 had breast cancer, 23 had ovarian cancers, 29 had GI cancers including gastroesophageal junction (GEJ)/ stomach/periampullary/colorectal, and 12 had leukemias. The most common intraoperative complication was catheter tip malposition (9.2%). The most common postoperative complications were infection (7.5%), followed by drug extravasation (5.0%), thrombosis (3.3%), wound dehiscence (2.5%), and skin necrosis (0.8%) in decreasing order of frequency. Serious complications such as hemothorax, pneumothorax, air emboli, brachial plexus injury, and pericardial tamponade, commonly reported in the literature, were not seen in any of our cases. CONCLUSION:  Totally implanted venous access devices (TIVAD)/chemoports are indispensable in the management of cancer patients, especially in patients requiring long duration of infusion and prolonged treatment. Although chemoports are associated with a spectrum of complications, proper technique of implantation and use makes it a safe and reliable tool.

    Title: Balancing Innovation and Patient Care in Breast Cancer: Integrating Hypofractionated Proton Therapy With Breast Reconstruction Outcomes.
    Authors: Fatima H, Abbas P, Alshehri SM
    Abstract: This review aims to assess the application of hypofractionated proton therapy in breast cancer reconstruction, analyzing its advantages, challenges, and broader implications for patient care. The goal is to comprehensively understand how this innovative approach can be integrated into breast cancer treatment. Proton therapy exhibits superior target coverage and safety, reducing radiation-induced complications and sparing critical organs, but skin toxicity outcomes differ from photon therapy. Tissue expanders are vital in breast reconstruction, employing innovative planning for positive long-term outcomes and highlighting the importance of balancing cancer treatment effectiveness with cosmetic outcomes. Hypofractionated proton therapy and breast cancer reconstruction present promising innovations with notable advantages in target coverage and organ sparing. However, variations in skin toxicity outcomes and the need for a careful balance between treatment effectiveness and cosmetic outcomes underscore ongoing challenges. Future directions should focus on refining treatment protocols, optimizing patient selection criteria, and integrating emerging technologies to enhance therapeutic outcomes while minimizing adverse effects.

    Title: The investigation of the death-inducing potency of a recombinant Adenovector expressing Mda-7-tlyp-1 on different cancer cell lines.
    Authors: Vatanparast F, Ghojoghi R, Kadkhodazadeh M, Nekooei F, Baesi K, Rastegari M, Jamali F, Farmani Z, Sarvari J, Hosseini SY
    Abstract: AIM: The potency of Adenovector expressing Mda7-tLyp1 (Ad-Mda7-tLyp1) for death induction was evaluated on the breast (MCF7), liver (HepG2), and gastric (MKN45) cancer cell lines. BACKGROUND: Mda-7 could be a possible complementary to traditional cancer therapy, and tethering to tumor-homing peptides (THPs) might improve its therapeutic efficacy. METHODS: After the preparation of recombinant Ad-Mda7-tLyp1 and Ad-Mda7, the expression of recombinant proteins was analyzed by ELISA. Adenovectors were transduced (MOI=2-5) into Hep-G2, MCF7, MKN45, and normal skin fibroblast, then tumor-killing effect was measured by cytopathic effect (CPE) monitoring, MTT viability test, BAX gene expression analysis, and Caspase3/7 assay. RESULTS: ELISA assay revealed a sustained level of recombinant protein secretion following Adenovector transduction. In CPE microscopy, all cancer cell lines showed a significant reduction (>/=50%) in their normal phenotype after receiving Ad-Mda7-tLyp1 and Ad-Mda7. The viability was significantly lower compared to the control, indicating an anti-proliferating effect. In parallel, the viability test showed that Ad-Mda7 and Ad-Mda7-tLyp1 have a significant killing effect (>/=50%) on MCF-7, Hep-G2, and MKN45 compared to normal fibroblast (P</=0.05). BAX gene expression analysis showed that both Ad-Mda7-tLyp1 and Ad-Mda7 vectors induced >2-fold increase of apoptosis (P<0.05), particularly in MCF7. Similarly, caspase3/7 activity showed a significant increase (P<0.05) following Ad-Mda7, and Ad-Mda7-tLyp1 transduction into cancer cell lines, but not in normal fibroblasts. CONCLUSION: The newly constructed Ad-Mda-tlyp1 showed a suitable tumor cell killing activity and enough specificity on studied cell lines.

    Title: Case report: From negative to positive: a remarkable journey of ER, PR and HER2 status in a patient with metastatic breast cancer.
    Authors: Huang J, Liu L, Ding J
    Abstract: Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor in women, posing a serious threat to women's health. HER2 has been identified as a key oncogene and prognostic factor in breast cancer. Recent studies have reported inconsistencies in ER, PR, and/or HER2 expression between primary breast tumors and metastatic lesions. Rarely is it reported that all three biomarkers experience conversion. In this report, we present the case of a female patient with relapsed and metastatic breast cancer, whose histology transformed from initially triple-negative to Luminal-B type (HER2 positive) (i.e., ER, PR, and HER2 positive). She underwent systematic chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and cranial radiotherapy, which was followed by maintenance treatment with targeted and endocrine therapy. Currently, she has been in nearly complete remission (nCR) for more than 12 months. For recurrent and metastatic breast cancer, it is necessary to perform the second biopsy for metastases, which would contribute to precision treatment and prognosis improvement.

    Title: Causal relationship between gut microbiota and differentiated thyroid cancer: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.
    Authors: Hu S, Tang C, Wang L, Feng F, Li X, Sun M, Yao L
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota has been significantly associated with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). However, the causal relationship between the gut microbiota and DTC remains unexplored. METHODS: Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary databases were utilized to select exposures and outcomes. The Mendelian randomization (MR) method was employed to investigate the causal relationship between the gut microbiota and DTC. A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the reliability of the findings. RESULTS: Four bacterial traits were associated with the risk of DTC: Class Mollicutes [odds ratio (OR) = 10.953, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 2.333-51.428, p = 0.002], Phylum Tenericutes (OR = 10.953, 95% CI: 2.333-51.428, p = 0.002), Genus Eggerthella (OR = 3.219, 95% CI: 1.033-10.024, p = 0.044), and Order Rhodospirillales (OR = 2.829, 95% CI: 1.096-7.299, p = 0.032). The large 95% CI range for the Class Mollicutes and the Phylum Tenericutes may be attributed to the small sample size. Additionally, four other bacterial traits were negatively associated with DTC: Genus Eubacterium fissicatena group (OR = 0.381, 95% CI: 0.148-0.979, p = 0.045), Genus Lachnospiraceae UCG008 (OR = 0.317, 95% CI: 0.125-0.801, p = 0.015), Genus Christensenellaceae R-7 group (OR = 0.134, 95% CI: 0.020-0.886, p = 0.037), and Genus Escherichia Shigella (OR = 0.170, 95% CI: 0.037-0.769, p = 0.021). CONCLUSION: These findings contribute to our understanding of the pathological mechanisms underlying DTC and provide novel insights for the clinical treatment of DTC.

    Title: Conservative medical intervention as a complement to CDT for BCRL therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
    Authors: Deng C, Wu Z, Cai Z, Zheng X, Tang C
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: The effect of first-line complex decongestive therapy (CDT) for breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) depending on various factors forces patients to seek additional treatment. Therefore, this meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of different conservative medical interventions as a complement to CDT. This is the first meta-analysis that includes various kinds of conservative treatments as adjunctive therapy to get broader knowledge and improve practical application value, which can provide recommendations to further improve BCRL patients' health status. METHODS: RCTs published before 18 December 2023 from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases were searched. RCTs that compared the effects of conservative medical intervention were included. A random-effects or fixed-effects model was used based on the heterogeneity findings. Study quality was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: Sixteen RCTs with 690 participants were included, comparing laser therapy, intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC), extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), electrotherapy, ultrasound, diet or diet in combination with synbiotic supplement, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), continuous passive motion (CPM), and negative pressure massage treatment (NMPT). The results revealed that conservative medical intervention as complement to CDT had benefits in improving lymphedema in volume/circumference of the upper extremity [SMD = -0.30, 95% CI = (-0.45, -0.15), P < 0.05, I (2 =) 51%], visual analog score (VAS) for pain [SMD = -3.35, 95% CI (-5.37, -1.33), P < 0.05, I (2 =) 96%], quality of life [SMD = 0.44, 95% CI (0.19, 0.69), P < 0.05, I (2 =) 0], and DASH/QuickDASH [SMD = -0.42, 95% CI (-0.70, -0.14), P < 0.05, I (2 =) 10%] compared with the control group. Subgroup analysis revealed that laser therapy and electrotherapy are especially effective (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Combining conservative medical interventions with CDT appears to have a positive effect on certain BCRL symptoms, especially laser therapy and electrotherapy. It showed a better effect on patients under 60 years old, and laser therapy of low to moderate intensity (5-24 mW, 1.5-2 J/cm(2)) and of moderate- to long-term duration (>/=36-72 sessions) showed better effects.

    Title: Functional hemodynamic imaging markers for the prediction of pathological outcomes in breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
    Authors: Deng B, Muldoon A, Cormier J, Mercaldo ND, Niehoff E, Moffett N, Saksena MA, Isakoff SJ, Carp SA
    Abstract: SIGNIFICANCE: Achieving pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is a significant predictor of increased likelihood of survival in breast cancer patients. Early prediction of pCR is of high clinical value as it could allow personalized adjustment of treatment regimens in non-responding patients for improved outcomes. AIM: We aim to assess the association between hemoglobin-based functional imaging biomarkers derived from diffuse optical tomography (DOT) and the pathological outcome represented by pCR at different timepoints along the course of NACT. APPROACH: Twenty-two breast cancer patients undergoing NACT were enrolled in a multimodal DOT and X-ray digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) imaging study in which their breasts were imaged at different compression levels. Logistic regressions were used to study the associations between DOT-derived imaging markers evaluated after the first and second cycles of chemotherapy, respectively, with pCR status determined after the conclusion of NACT at the time of surgery. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was also used to explore the predictive performance of selected DOT-derived markers. RESULTS: Normalized tumor HbT under half compression was significantly lower in the pCR group compared to the non-pCR group after two chemotherapy cycles (p = 0.042). In addition, the change in normalized tumor StO2 upon reducing compression from full to half mammographic force was identified as another potential indicator of pCR at an earlier time point, i.e., after the first chemo cycle (p = 0.038). Exploratory predictive assessments showed that AUCs using DOT-derived functional imaging markers as predictors reach as high as 0.75 and 0.71, respectively, after the first and second chemo cycle, compared to AUCs of 0.50 and 0.53 using changes in tumor size measured on DBT and MRI. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that breast DOT could be used to assist response assessment in women undergoing NACT, a critical but unmet clinical need, and potentially enable personalized adjustments of treatment regimens.

    Title: Regulation of cellular and molecular markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition by Brazilin in breast cancer cells.
    Authors: Cayetano-Salazar L, Hernandez-Moreno JA, Bello-Martinez J, Olea-Flores M, Castaneda-Saucedo E, Ramirez M, Mendoza-Catalan MA, Navarro-Tito N
    Abstract: Breast cancer is the most common invasive neoplasm and the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide. The main cause of mortality in cancer patients is invasion and metastasis, where the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial player in these processes. Pharmacological therapy has plants as its primary source, including isoflavonoids. Brazilin is an isoflavonoid isolated from Haematoxilum brasiletto that has shown antiproliferative activity in several cancer cell lines. In this study, we evaluated the effect of Brazilin on canonical markers of EMT such as E-cadherin, vimentin, Twist, and matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). By Western blot, we evaluated E-cadherin, vimentin, and Twist expression and the subcellular localization by immunofluorescence. Using gelatin zymography, we determined the levels of secretion of MMPs. We used Transwell chambers coated with matrigel to determine the in vitro invasion of breast cancer cells treated with Brazilin. Interestingly, our results show that Brazilin increases 50% in E-cadherin expression and decreases 50% in vimentin and Twist expression, MMPs, and cell invasion in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA-MB-231 and to a lesser extend in MCF7 ER+ breast cancer cells. Together, these findings position Brazilin as a new molecule with great potential for use as complementary or alternative treatment in breast cancer therapy in the future.

    Title: The dual role of LOXL4 in the pathogenesis and development of human malignant tumors: a narrative review.
    Authors: Liu R, Li B, Zi J, Zhang R, Yu M, Zhou J, Pu Y, Xiong W
    Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Lysyl oxidase-like protein 4 (LOXL4) is a secreted copper-dependent amine oxidase involved in the assembly and maintenance of extracellular matrix (ECM), playing a critical role in ECM formation and repair. Tumor-stroma interactions and ECM dysregulation are closely associated with the mechanisms underlying tumor initiation and progression. LOXL4 is the latest identified member of the lysyl oxidase (LOX) protein family. Currently, there is limited and controversial research on the role of LOXL4 in human malignancies. Its specific regulatory pathways, mechanisms, and roles in the occurrence, development, and treatment of malignancies remain incompletely understood. This article aims to illustrate the primary protein structure and the function of LOXL4 protein, and the relationship between LOXL4 protein and the occurrence and development of human malignant tumors to provide a reference for further clinical research. METHODS: We searched the English literature on LOXL4 in the occurrence and development of various malignant tumors in PubMed and Web of Science. The search keywords include "cancer" "LOXL4" "malignant tumor" "tumorigenesis and development", etc. KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: LOXL4 is up-regulated in human gastric cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma and colorectal cancer, but down-regulated in human bladder cancer and lung cancer and inhibits tumor growth. There are two conflicting reports of both upregulation and downregulation in hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting that LOXL4 has a bidirectional effect of promoting or inhibiting cancer in different types of human malignant tumors. We further explore the application prospect of LOXL4 protein in the study of malignant tumors, laying a theoretical foundation for the clinical diagnosis, treatment and screening of prognostic markers of malignant tumors. CONCLUSIONS: LOXL4 exerts a bidirectional regulatory role, either inhibiting or promoting tumors depending on the type of cancer. We still need more research to further confirm the molecular mechanism of LOXL4 in cancer progression.

    Title: Association between human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status, namely low and zero expression, and prognosis in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer: a single-center retrospective study.
    Authors: Hara Y, Yano H, Ishida Y, Iwasaki K, Yamaguchi R
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: The recently developed anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) therapy has substantially improved the prognosis of HER2-positive breast cancer. The DESTINY-Breast04 trial results showed that trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) significantly prolonged the survival of patients with HER2-low breast cancer, thus presenting a paradigm shift in anti-HER2 therapy. This may facilitate a change in the treatment strategy for HER2-low breast cancer. However, the implication of HER2-low in hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer is unclear. In this retrospective study, we aimed to reveal the association between HER2 status, namely HER2-low and HER2-zero, and prognosis in HR-positive breast cancer. METHODS: We collected the data of 247 patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer (159 with HER2-low and 88 with HER2-zero breast cancer) who underwent surgery. Patients were divided into HER2-low and HER2-zero groups. Univariate analysis was performed to evaluate the baseline characteristics using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and Fisher's exact test. Survival analysis of the HER2-low and HER2-zero groups was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: The median observation period was 2,706 days, and the median period until recurrence was 1,380 days; 25 patients (10%) had recurrences. Age (P=0.004) and menopausal status (P=0.04) were significant variables in the univariate analysis of baseline characteristics. In the subgroup analysis of luminal A- and B-like breast cancers, there was a significant difference in overall survival (OS) only in patients with luminal A-like breast cancer, but relapse-free survival (RFS) of the HER2-low luminal B-like cancer subgroups tended to be relatively short. CONCLUSIONS: We inferred that the HER2-low and HER2-zero statuses do not affect the RFS and OS of patients with ER-positive breast cancer. The prognostic significance of HER2-low or HER2-zero status in luminal A- and B-like breast cancers might differ, and a new treatment strategy is required for the HER2-low subgroup.

    Title: Augmented antitumor immune responses of HER2-targeted pyroptotic induction by long-lasting recombinant immunopyroptotins.
    Authors: Xing Y, Zhang F, Yang T, Yin C, Yang A, Yan B, Zhao J
    Abstract: Pyroptosis is a well-documented form of programmed cell death caused by the gasdermin-driven perforation of cell membranes. Selective induction of pyroptosis in tumor cells represents a promising antitumor strategy to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy. In this study, we established a recombinant protein-based immunopyroptotin strategy that led to the intratumoral induction of pyroptosis for HER2-directed therapy. Long-lasting immunopyroptotins were constructed by sequentially fusing the humanized anti-HER2 single-chain antibody P1h3, albumin-binding peptide (ABD035 or dAb7h8), cathepsin B-cleavable peptide B2, endosome-disruptive peptide E5C3, and active pyroptotic effector gasdermin D-N fragment (GN). After purification, we evaluated the cytotoxicity and antitumor immune responses primarily induced by the immunopyroptotins in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. The resulting ABD035-immunoGN and dAb7h8-immunoGN showed improved in vitro cytotoxicity in HER2-overexpressing cancer cells compared with that in the immunotBid that we previously generated to induce tumor cell apoptosis. The binding of long-lasting immunopyroptotins to albumin increased the half-life by approximately 7-fold in nude mice. The enhanced antitumor efficacy of long-lasting immunopyroptotins was confirmed in both N87 tumor-bearing T cell-deficient mice and 4T1-hHER2 bilateral tumor-bearing immunocompetent mice. Immunopyroptotin treatment elicited systemic antitumor immune responses involving CD8(+) T cells and mature dendritic cells and upregulated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, leading to sustained remission of non-injected distant tumors. This study extends the repertoire of antibody-based therapeutics through the tumor-targeted delivery of a constitutively active pore-forming gasdermin-N fragment, which shows great potential for pyroptosis-based antitumor therapy.

    Title: DNA methylation regulator-based molecular subtyping and tumor microenvironment characterization in hepatocellular carcinoma.
    Authors: Zhao J, Liu Z, Yang K, Shen S, Peng J
    Abstract: BACKGROUD: Although recent studies have reported the regulation of the immune response in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through DNA methylation, the comprehensive impact methylation modifications on tumor microenvironment characteristics and immunotherapy efficacy has not been fully elucidated. METHODS: In this research, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of the patterns of DNA methylation regulators and the profiles of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in HCC, focusing on 21 specific DNA methylation regulators. We subsequently developed a unique scoring system, a DNA methylation score (DMscore), to assess the individual DNA methylation modifications among the three distinct methylation patterns for differentially expressed genes (DEGs). RESULTS: Three distinct methylation modification patterns were identified with distinct TME infiltration characteristics. We demonstrated that the DMscore could predict patient subtype, TME infiltration, and patient prognosis. A low DMscore, characterized by an elevated tumor mutation burden (TMB), hepatitis B virus (HBV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and immune activation, indicates an inflamed tumor microenvironment phenotype with a 5-year survival rate of 7.8%. Moreover, a low DMscore appeared to increase the efficacy of immunotherapy in the anti-CTLA-4/PD-1/PD-L1 cohort. CONCLUSIONS: In brief, this research has enhanced our understanding of the correlation between modifications in DNA methylation patterns and the profile of the tumor microenvironment in individuals diagnosed with HCC. The DMscore may serve as an alternative biomarker for survival and efficacy of immunotherapy in patients with HCC.

    Title: Personalized circulating tumor DNA response to local radiotherapy in a patient with an early lobular breast cancer: A case report.
    Authors: Capella MP, Fallah P, Basik M
    Abstract: The detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the plasma of cancer patients is emerging as a very sensitive and specific prognostic biomarker. Previous studies with ctDNA have focused on the ability of ctDNA detection to predict micrometastatic and eventual clinical metastatic relapse. There are few data on the role of ctDNA in monitoring response to local therapy. The present study reports the case of a patient with early-stage lobular breast cancer, with a detectable ctDNA test which resolved with local radiotherapy to the breast. This case suggests that ctDNA is sensitive enough to detect the response of minimal residual disease, localized in the breast, to radiation therapy, and thus may assist in providing indications for local breast cancer treatment.

    Title: Assessment of the impact of residual tumors at different sites post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy on prognosis in breast cancer patients and development of a disease-free survival prediction model.
    Authors: Yang H, Ruan Y, Sun Y, Wang P, Qiao J, Wang C, Liu Z
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer patients predicts worse outcomes than pathological complete response. Differing prognostic impacts based on the anatomical site of residual tumors are not well studied. OBJECTIVES: The study aims to assess disease-free survival (DFS) in breast cancer patients with different residual tumor sites following NAC and to develop a nomogram for predicting 1- to 3-year DFS in these patients. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 953 lymph node-positive breast cancer patients with residual disease post-NAC. Patients were categorized into three groups: residual disease in breast (RDB), residual disease in lymph nodes (RDN), and residual disease in both (RDBN). DFS compared among groups. Patients were divided into a training set and a validation set in a 7:3 ratio. Prognostic factors for DFS were analyzed to develop a nomogram prediction model. RESULTS: RDB patients had superior 3-year DFS of 94.6% versus 85.2% for RDN and 81.8% for RDBN (p < 0.0001). Clinical T stage, N stage, molecular subtype, and postoperative pN stage were independently associated with DFS on both univariate and multivariate analyses. Nomogram integrating clinical tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, molecular subtype, pathological response demonstrated good discrimination (C-index 0.748 training, 0.796 validation cohort), and calibration. CONCLUSION: The location of residual disease has prognostic implications, with nodal residuals predicting poorer DFS. The validated nomogram enables personalized DFS prediction to guide treatment decisions.

    Title: Integrated Electronic Health Record of Multidisciplinary Professionals Throughout the Cancer Care Pathway: A Pilot Study Exploring Patient-Centered Information in Breast Cancer Patients.
    Authors: Sugiyama A, Okumiya H, Fujimoto K, Utsunomiya K, Shimomura Y, Sanuki M, Kume K, Yano T, Kagawa R, Bando H
    Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this pilot study was to first aggregate and then integrate the medical records of various healthcare professionals involved with breast cancer patients to reveal if and how patient-centered information is documented in multidisciplinary cancer care. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We aggregated 20 types of medical records from various healthcare professionals such as physicians, nurses and allied healthcare professionals (AHPs) throughout three breast cancer patients' care pathways in a department of breast surgery at a university hospital. Purposeful sampling was used, and three cases were examined. The number of integrated type of records was 14, 14, 17 in case 1, 2 and 3, respectively. We manually annotated and analyzed them exploratively using a thematic analysis. The tags were produced using both a deductive template approach and a data-driven inductive approach. All records were then given tags. We defined patient-centered information related tags and biomedical information related tags and then analyzed for if and how patient-centered information was documented. RESULTS: The number of patient-centered information related tags accounted for 30%, 30% and 20% of the total in case 1, 2 and 3, respectively. In all cases, patient-centered information was distributed across various medical records. The Progress Note written by doctors provided much of the patient-centered information, while other records contained information not described elsewhere in the Progress Notes. The records of nurses and AHPs included more patient-centered information than the doctors' notes. Each piece of patient-centered information was documented in fragments providing from each of the healthcare professionals' viewpoints. CONCLUSION: The documented information throughout the breast cancer care pathway in the cases examined was dominated by biomedical information. However, our findings suggest that integrating fragmented patient-centered information from various healthcare professionals' medical records produces holistic patient-centered information from multiple perspectives and thus may facilitate an enhanced multidisciplinary patient-centered care.

    Title: Breast cancer incidence and mortality by metabolic syndrome and obesity: The Women's Health Initiative.
    Authors: Chlebowski RT, Aragaki AK, Pan K, Simon MS, Neuhouser ML, Haque R, Rohan TE, Wactawski-Wende J, Orchard TS, Mortimer JE, Lane D, Kaunitz AM, Desai P, Wild RA, Barac A, Manson JE
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: In the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized trial, dietary intervention significantly reduced breast cancer mortality, especially in women with more metabolic syndrome (MetS) components. Therefore, this study investigated the associations of MetS and obesity with postmenopausal breast cancer after long-term follow-up in the WHI clinical trials. METHODS: A total of 68,132 postmenopausal women, without prior breast cancer and with normal mammogram, were entered into WHI randomized clinical trials; 63,330 women with an entry MetS score comprised the study population. At entry, body mass index (BMI) was determined; MetS score (0, 1-2, and 3-4) included the following: (1) high waist circumference (>/=88 cm), (2) high blood pressure (systolic >/=130 mm Hg and/or diastolic >/=85 mm Hg, or hypertension history), (3) high-cholesterol history, and (4) diabetes history. Study outcomes included breast cancer incidence, breast cancer mortality, deaths after breast cancer, and results by hormone receptor status. RESULTS: After a >20-year mortality follow-up, a higher MetS score (3-4), adjusted for BMI, was significantly associated with more poor prognosis, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, progesterone receptor (PR)-negative cancers (p = .03), 53% more deaths after breast cancer (p < .001), and 44% higher breast cancer mortality (p = .03). Obesity status, adjusted for MetS score, was significantly associated with more good prognosis, ER-positive, PR-positive cancers (p < .001), more total breast cancers (p < .001), and more deaths after breast cancer (p < .001), with higher breast cancer mortality only in women with severe obesity (BMI, >/=35 kg/m(2); p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: MetS and obesity status have independent, but differential, adverse associations with breast cancer receptor subtypes and breast cancer mortality risk. Both represent separate targets for breast cancer prediction and prevention strategies.

    Title: A dosiomics model for prediction of radiation-induced acute skin toxicity in breast cancer patients: machine learning-based study for a closed bore linac.
    Authors: Saadatmand P, Mahdavi SR, Nikoofar A, Jazaeri SZ, Ramandi FL, Esmaili G, Vejdani S
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Radiation induced acute skin toxicity (AST) is considered as a common side effect of breast radiation therapy. The goal of this study was to design dosiomics-based machine learning (ML) models for prediction of AST, to enable creating optimized treatment plans for high-risk individuals. METHODS: Dosiomics features extracted using Pyradiomics tool (v3.0.1), along with treatment plan-derived dose volume histograms (DVHs), and patient-specific treatment-related (PTR) data of breast cancer patients were used for modeling. Clinical scoring was done using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V4.0 criteria for skin-specific symptoms. The 52 breast cancer patients were grouped into AST 2 + (CTCAE >/= 2) and AST 2 - (CTCAE < 2) toxicity grades to facilitate AST modeling. They were randomly divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) cohorts. Multiple prediction models were assessed through multivariate analysis, incorporating different combinations of feature groups (dosiomics, DVH, and PTR) individually and collectively. In total, seven unique combinations, along with seven classification algorithms, were considered after feature selection. The performance of each model was evaluated on the test group using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and f1-score. Accuracy, precision, and recall of each model were also studied. Statistical analysis involved features differences between AST 2 - and AST 2 + groups and cutoff value calculations. RESULTS: Results showed that 44% of the patients developed AST 2 + after Tomotherapy. The dosiomics (DOS) model, developed using dosiomics features, exhibited a noteworthy improvement in AUC (up to 0.78), when spatial information is preserved in the dose distribution, compared to DVH features (up to 0.71). Furthermore, a baseline ML model created using only PTR features for comparison with DOS models showed the significance of dosiomics in early AST prediction. By employing the Extra Tree (ET) classifiers, the DOS + DVH + PTR model achieved a statistically significant improved performance in terms of AUC (0.83; 95% CI 0.71-0.90), accuracy (0.70), precision (0.74) and sensitivity (0.72) compared to other models. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the benefit of dosiomics-based ML in the prediction of AST. However, the combination of dosiomics, DVH, and PTR yields significant improvement in AST prediction. The results of this study provide the opportunity for timely interventions to prevent the occurrence of radiation induced AST.

    Title: SEEI: spherical evolution with feedback mechanism for identifying epistatic interactions.
    Authors: Tang DY, Mao YJ, Zhao J, Yang J, Li SY, Ren FX, Zheng J
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Detecting epistatic interactions (EIs) involves the exploration of associations among single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and complex diseases, which is an important task in genome-wide association studies. The EI detection problem is dependent on epistasis models and corresponding optimization methods. Although various models and methods have been proposed to detect EIs, identifying EIs efficiently and accurately is still a challenge. RESULTS: Here, we propose a linear mixed statistical epistasis model (LMSE) and a spherical evolution approach with a feedback mechanism (named SEEI). The LMSE model expands the existing single epistasis models such as LR-Score, K2-Score, Mutual information, and Gini index. The SEEI includes an adaptive spherical search strategy and population updating strategy, which ensures that the algorithm is not easily trapped in local optima. We analyzed the performances of 8 random disease models, 12 disease models with marginal effects, 30 disease models without marginal effects, and 10 high-order disease models. The 60 simulated disease models and a real breast cancer dataset were used to evaluate eight algorithms (SEEI, EACO, EpiACO, FDHEIW, MP-HS-DHSI, NHSA-DHSC, SNPHarvester, CSE). Three evaluation criteria (pow1, pow2, pow3), a T-test, and a Friedman test were used to compare the performances of these algorithms. The results show that the SEEI algorithm (order 1, averages ranks = 13.125) outperformed the other algorithms in detecting EIs. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we propose an LMSE model and an evolutionary computing method (SEEI) to solve the optimization problem of the LMSE model. The proposed method performed better than the other seven algorithms tested in its ability to identify EIs in genome-wide association datasets. We identified new SNP-SNP combinations in the real breast cancer dataset and verified the results. Our findings provide new insights for the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.

    Title: Ternary heterostructure-driven photoinduced electron-hole separation enhanced oxidative stress for triple-negative breast cancer therapy.
    Authors: Dong S, Huang Y, Yan H, Tan H, Fan L, Chao M, Ren Y, Guan M, Zhang J, Liu Z, Gao F
    Abstract: Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) stand as among the most significant metal oxide nanoparticles in trigger the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induce apoptosis. Nevertheless, the utilization of ZnO NPs has been limited by the shallowness of short-wavelength light and the constrained production of ROS. To overcome these limitations, a strategy involves achieving a red shift towards the near-infrared (NIR) light spectrum, promoting the separation and restraining the recombination of electron-hole (e(-)-h(+)) pairs. Herein, the hybrid plasmonic system Au@ZnO (AZ) with graphene quantum dots (GQDs) doping (AZG) nano heterostructures is rationally designed for optimal NIR-driven cancer treatment. Significantly, a multifold increase in ROS generation can be achieved through the following creative initiatives: (i) plasmonic Au nanorods expands the photocatalytic capabilities of AZG into the NIR domain, offering a foundation for NIR-induced ROS generation for clinical utilization; (ii) elaborate design of mesoporous core-shell AZ structures facilitates the redistribution of electron-hole pairs; (iii) the incorporation GQDs in mesoporous structure could efficiently restrain the recombination of the e(-)-h(+) pairs; (iv) Modification of hyaluronic acid (HA) can enhance CD44 receptor mediated targeted triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In addition, the introduced Au NRs present as catalysts for enhancing photothermal therapy (PTT), effectively inducing apoptosis in tumor cells. The resulting HA-modified AZG (AZGH) exhibits efficient hot electron injection and e(-)-h(+) separation, affording unparalleled convenience for ROS production and enabling NIR-induced PDT for the cancer treanment. As a result, our well-designed mesoporous core-shell AZGH hybrid as photosensitizers can exhibit excellent PDT efficacy.

    Abstract: Metaplastic breast cancer is a rare, aggressive, and chemotherapy-resistant subtype of breast cancers, accounting for less than 1% of invasive breast cancers, characterized by adenocarcinoma with spindle cells, squamous epithelium, and/or mesenchymal tissue differentiation. The majority of metaplastic breast cancers exhibit the characteristics of triple-negative breast cancer and have unfavorable prognoses with a lower survival rate. This subtype often displays gene alterations in the PI3K/AKT pathway, Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, and cell cycle dysregulation and demonstrates epithelial-mesenchymal transition, immune response changes, TP53 mutation, EGFR amplification, and so on. Currently, the optimal treatment of metaplastic breast cancer remains uncertain. This article provides a comprehensive review on the clinical features, molecular characteristics, invasion and metastasis patterns, and prognosis of metaplastic breast cancer, as well as recent advancements in treatment strategies.

    Title: De-escalation of Axillary Surgery After Neoadjuvant Therapy.
    Authors: Connors C, Al-Hilli Z
    Abstract: Surgical de-escalation of the axilla has evolved over the past 28 years since the emergence of sentinel lymph node surgery. Well-documented complications of the once standard of care axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), including lymphedema, led physician scientists towards a progressive push to study and incorporate less invasive techniques in the axilla. Many trials have justified oncologic safety of axillary de-escalation in patients who are spared neoadjuvant treatment. The applicability in the neoadjuvant setting, however, is less clear and axillary surgical approaches in this patient population have evolved at a slower pace. This review aims to analyze current data in axillary management for patients undergoing neoadjuvant treatment and to discuss current surgical approaches based on nodal pathologic response.

    Title: Symptomatic adverse events of chemotherapy in breast cancer patients:Using CTCAE, PRO-CTCAE, and EORTC QLQ-C30.
    Authors: Arahori H, Kondo K, Imai Y, Bando T, Inoue H, Sasa S, Takizawa H
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) is used as a tool to evaluate the adverse events (AE) of chemotherapy in cancer patients. Since CTCAE by medical providers underestimates AE more than patient-reported outcomes (PRO), the National Cancer Institute developed PRO-CTCAE. The present study investigated differences between symptoms detected using CTCAE by medical providers and PRO-CTCAE by breast cancer patients. METHODS: Patients received chemotherapy comprising epirubicin and cyclophosphamide pre- or postoperatively. AE were evaluated using 4 questionnaires:PRO-CTCAE, CTCAE, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-30), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) after 1, 2, and 3 courses of chemotherapy. RESULTS: Forty-two patients were registered. Regarding the recognition of psychological symptoms, such as fatigue, anxiety, and discouragement, and subjective symptoms, including heart palpitations and shortness of breath, PRO using PRO-CTCAE was significantly higher than medical provider-recognized outcomes using CTCAE. Concerning the recognition of regimen-specific symptoms, such as vomiting, nausea, and decreased appetite, medical provider- recognized outcomes were the same or higher than PRO. In QLQ-C30, the physical and role functions, fatigue and dyspnea significantly worsened after 2 and 3 courses of chemotherapy. J. Med. Invest. 71 : 82-91, February, 2024.

    Title: Ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast: finding the balance between overtreatment and undertreatment.
    Authors: Delaloge S, Khan SA, Wesseling J, Whelan T
    Abstract: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) accounts for 15-25% of all breast cancer diagnoses. Its prognosis is excellent overall, the main risk being the occurrence of local breast events, as most cases of DCIS do not progress to invasive cancer. Systematic screening has greatly increased the incidence of this non-obligate precursor of invasion, lending urgency to the need to identify DCIS that is prone to invasive progression and distinguish it from non-invasion-prone DCIS, as the latter can be overdiagnosed and therefore overtreated. Treatment strategies, including surgery, radiotherapy, and optional endocrine therapy, decrease the risk of local events, but have no effect on survival outcomes. Active surveillance is being evaluated as a possible new option for low-risk DCIS. Considerable efforts to decipher the biology of DCIS have led to a better understanding of the factors that determine its variable natural history. Given this variability, shared decision making regarding optimal, personalised treatment strategies is the most appropriate course of action. Well designed, risk-based de-escalation studies remain a major need in this field.

    Title: Assessment of safety and tolerability of subcutaneous trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer: Results of an open-label, randomized, multicenter, phase IIIB ESCAPE trial.
    Authors: Kaidarova D, Zhavrid E, Shatkovskaya O, Prokharau A, Akhmed N, Sembayev D, Rutzhanova Z, Ivankov A
    Abstract: AIM: To assess the safety and tolerability of subcutaneous (SC) trastuzumab (Herceptin) administered either with a single-use injection device (SID) or manually from a vial using a hand-held syringe. METHODS: The ESCAPE trial (NCT02194166) included 90 women aged 18 years or older with HER2-positive early breast cancer who underwent surgical treatment and completed (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy (if indicated). Patients enrolled in the study were first subjected to 4 cycles of trastuzumab IV (8 mg/kg loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg maintenance dose, q3w) prior to being randomized into groups: [A] SC trastuzumab (fixed dose 600 mg, q3w) administered through a hand-held syringe followed by 7 cycles of SC trastuzumab administered with an SID or [B] the reverse sequence. RESULTS: Patient-reported outcomes revealed that 78 (94.0 % [95 % CI: 90.4-99.0]) out of 83 patients preferred SC trastuzumab over IV trastuzumab, among whom 28 patients indicated a strong preference. Sixteen out of 17 HCPs (94.1 %) were very satisfied with the use of SC trastuzumab, while 1/17 (5.9 %) remained uncertain. The mean time spent for IV vs. SC trastuzumab administration, including pre- and postinjection procedures, was 93.8 and 22 min, respectively. A total of 49 (54.4 %) patients reported 164 AEs. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, SC trastuzumab was preferred over IV trastuzumab. The duration of SC trastuzumab administration was significantly shorter than that of IV trastuzumab, saving patients and HCPs time. Safety and efficacy results were consistent with other published trials and were not associated with any new safety signal.

    Title: Prognostic significance of HER2 loss after HER2-targeted neoadjuvant treatment in patients with HER2-positive locally advanced breast cancer.
    Authors: Kutlu Y, Cekin R, Aydin SG, Shbair ATM, Bilici A, Arici S, Oven BB, Acikgoz O, Ozcan E, Olmez OF, Cakir A, Seker M
    Abstract: Loss of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression can be seen in almost 25-30 % patients after HER2 receptor directed neoadjuvant treatment. These patients have unclear clinical outcomes in previous studies. We aimed to investigate the importance of HER2 loss, additionally with predictive factors for the loss of HER2. This was a retrospective and multicenter study that included 272 HER2-positive BC patients with no pathological complete response who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus HER2-targeted treatments. The factors that may affect the loss of HER2 detected by immunohistochemistry(IHC) and the association with survival were analyzed.The rate of HER2 loss after neoadjuvant treatments(NAT) was 27.9 % (n = 76). Disease recurrence was observed in 18(23.7 %) patients with HER2 loss, while it was detected in 62 (31.7 %) patients without HER2 loss(p = 0.23). Pre and post-NAT ER status, and post-NAT ki-67 status had a significant impact on disease-free survival(DFS) (p = 0.0012, p = 0.004, and p = 0.04, respectively).There were no significant association between DFS and loss of HER2 (p = 0.64) and dual anti-HER2 blockade (p = 0.21). Pre-NAT clinical stage (HR:1.65 p = 0.013), post-NAT LN status (HR:3.18, p = 0.02) and pre-NAT ER status (HR:0.24, p = 0.041) were significant independent prognostic factors for DFS while post-NAT residual disease in axillar tissue was an independent prognostic factor for OS (HR:1.54 p = 0.019). Moreover, age (<40 years vs >/=40 years) (p = 0.031) and tumor grade (p = 0.004) were predictive factors for HER2 loss. Our results showed that HER2 loss did not affect survivals. However, young age and being high grade tumor may predict HER2 loss.

    Title: Function and mechanism of action of the TRPV1 channel in the development of triple-negative breast cancer.
    Authors: Yan Z, Huang H, Wang Q, Kong Y, Liu X
    Abstract: Transient receptor potential channel subfamily vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a member of the transient receptor potential family of nonselective cationic transmembrane channel proteins that are involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis. It is expressed in various tumor types and has been implicated in the regulation of cancer growth, metastasis, apoptosis, and cancer-related pain. TRPV1 is highly expressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and both its agonists and antagonists may exert anti-cancer effects. In this review, we provide an overview of the effect of TRPV1 on TNBC development and its influence on immunotherapy in an attempt to facilitate the development of future treatment strategies.

    Title: Rapamycin prevents cyclophosphamide-induced ovarian follicular loss and potentially inhibits tumour proliferation in a breast cancer xenograft mouse model.
    Authors: Tanaka Y, Amano T, Nakamura A, Yoshino F, Takebayashi A, Takahashi A, Yamanaka H, Inatomi A, Hanada T, Yoneoka Y, Tsuji S, Murakami T
    Abstract: STUDY QUESTION: To what extent and via what mechanism does the concomitant administration of rapamycin (a follicle activation pathway inhibitor and antitumour agent) and cyclophosphamide (a highly toxic ovarian anticancer agent) prevent cyclophosphamide-induced ovarian reserve loss and inhibit tumour proliferation in a breast cancer xenograft mouse model? SUMMARY ANSWER: Daily concomitant administration of rapamycin and a cyclic regimen of cyclophosphamide, which has sufficient antitumour effects as a single agent, suppressed cyclophosphamide-induced primordial follicle loss by inhibiting primordial follicle activation in a breast cancer xenograft mouse model, suggesting the potential of an additive inhibitory effect against tumour proliferation. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Cyclophosphamide stimulates primordial follicles by activating the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, resulting in the accumulation of primary follicles, most of which undergo apoptosis. Rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, regulates primordial follicle activation and exhibits potential inhibitory effects against breast cancer cell proliferation. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: To assess ovarian follicular apoptosis, 3 weeks after administering breast cancer cells, 8-week-old mice were randomized into three treatment groups: control, cyclophosphamide, and cyclophosphamide + rapamycin (Cy + Rap) (n = 5 or 6 mice/group). Mice were treated with rapamycin or vehicle control for 1 week, followed by a single dose of cyclophosphamide or vehicle control. Subsequently, the ovaries were resected 24 h after cyclophosphamide administration (short-term treatment groups). To evaluate follicle abundance and the mTOR pathway in ovaries, as well as the antitumour effects and impact on the mTOR pathway in tumours, 8-week-old xenograft breast cancer transplanted mice were randomized into three treatment groups: vehicle control, Cy, and Cy + Rap (n = 6 or 7 mice/group). Rapamycin (5 mg/kg) or the vehicle was administered daily for 29 days. Cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) or the vehicle was administered thrice weekly (long-term treatment groups). The tumour diameter was measured weekly. Seven days after the last cyclophosphamide treatment, the ovaries were harvested, fixed, and sectioned (for follicle counting) or frozen (for further analysis). Similarly, the tumours were resected and fixed or frozen. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) was performed to examine ovarian follicular apoptosis in the short-term treatment groups. All subsequent experiments were conducted in the long-term treatment groups. Tumour growth was evaluated using the tumour volume index. The tumour volume index indicates the relative volume, compared to the volume 3 weeks after tumour cell injection (at treatment initiation) set to 100%. Tumour cell proliferation was evaluated by Ki-67 immunostaining. Activation of the mTOR pathway in tumours was assessed using the protein extracts from tumours and analysed by western blotting. Haematoxylin and eosin staining of ovaries was used to perform differential follicle counts for primordial, primary, secondary, antral, and atretic follicles. Activation of the mTOR pathway in ovaries was assessed using protein extracts from whole ovaries and analysed by western blotting. Localization of mTOR pathway activation within ovaries was assessed by performing anti-phospho-S6 kinase (downstream of mTOR pathway) immunohistochemistry. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Ovaries of the short-term treatment groups were resected 24 h after cyclophosphamide administration and subjected to TUNEL staining of apoptotic cells. No TUNEL-positive primordial follicles were detected in the control, Cy, and Cy + Rap groups. Conversely, many granulosa cells of growing follicles were TUNEL positive in the Cy group but negative in the control and Cy + Rap groups. All subsequent experimental results were obtained from the long-term treatment groups. The tumour volume index stabilized at a mean of 160-200% in the Cy group and 130% in the Cy + Rap group throughout the treatment period. In contrast, tumours in the vehicle control group grew continuously with a mean tumour volume index of 600%, significantly greater than that of the two treatment groups. Based on the western blot analysis of tumours, the mTOR pathway was activated in the vehicle control group and downregulated in the Cy + Rap group when compared with the control and Cy groups. Ki-67 immunostaining of tumours showed significant inhibition of cell proliferation in the Cy + Rap group when compared with that in the control and Cy groups. The ovarian follicle count revealed that the Cy group had significantly fewer primordial follicles (P < 0.001) than the control group, whereas the Cy + Rap group had significantly higher number of primordial follicles (P < 0.001, 2.5 times) than the Cy group. The ratio of primary to primordial follicles was twice as high in the Cy group than in the control group; however, no significant difference was observed between the control group and the Cy + Rap group. Western blot analysis of ovaries revealed that the mTOR pathway was activated by cyclophosphamide and inhibited by rapamycin. The phospho-S6 kinase (pS6K)-positive primordial follicle rate was 2.7 times higher in the Cy group than in the control group. However, this effect was suppressed to a level similar to the control group in the Cy + Rap group. LARGE SCALE DATA: None. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The combinatorial treatment of breast cancer tumours with rapamycin and cyclophosphamide elicited inhibitory effects on cell proliferative potential compared to cyclophosphamide monotherapy. However, no statistically significant additive effect was observed on tumour volume. Thus, the beneficial antitumour effect afforded by rapamycin administration on breast cancer could not be definitively proven. Although rapamycin has ovarian-protective effects, it does not fully counteract the ovarian toxicity of cyclophosphamide. Nevertheless, rapamycin is advantageous as an ovarian protective agent as it can be used in combination with other ovarian protective agents, such as hormonal therapy. Hence, in combination with other agents, mTOR inhibitors may be sufficiently ovario-protective against high-dose and cyclic cyclophosphamide regimens. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Compared with a cyclic cyclophosphamide regimen that replicates human clinical practice under breast cancer-bearing conditions, the combination with rapamycin mitigates the ovarian follicle loss of cyclophosphamide without interfering with the anticipated antitumour effects. Hence, rapamycin may represent a new non-invasive treatment option for cyclophosphamide-induced ovarian dysfunction in breast cancer patients. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This work was not financially supported. The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.

    Title: Breast Articles From 2023: Informing Practice Across the Continuum of Care.
    Authors: King TA, Mittendorf EA
    Abstract: With new investigations and clinical trials in breast oncology reported every year, it is critical that surgeons be aware of advances and insights into the evolving care paradigms and treatments available to their patients. This article highlights five publications found to be particularly impactful this past year. These articles report on efforts to select the minimal effective dose of tamoxifen for prevention, to challenge the existing age-based screening guidelines as they relate to race and ethnicity, to refine axillary management treatment standards, to optimize systemic therapy in multidisciplinary care settings, and to reduce the burden of breast cancer-related lymphedema after treatment. Taken together, these efforts have an impact on all facets of the continuum of care from prevention and screening through treatment and survivorship.

    Title: UK guidelines for the management of soft tissue sarcomas.
    Authors: Hayes AJ, Nixon IF, Strauss DC, Seddon BM, Desai A, Benson C, Judson IR, Dangoor A
    Abstract: Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are rare tumours arising in mesenchymal tissues and can occur almost anywhere in the body. Their rarity, and the heterogeneity of subtype and location, means that developing evidence-based guidelines is complicated by the limitations of the data available. This makes it more important that STS are managed by expert multidisciplinary teams, to ensure consistent and optimal treatment, recruitment to clinical trials, and the ongoing accumulation of further data and knowledge. The development of appropriate guidance, by an experienced panel referring to the evidence available, is therefore a useful foundation on which to build progress in the field. These guidelines are an update of the previous versions published in 2010 and 2016 [1, 2]. The original guidelines were drawn up by a panel of UK sarcoma specialists convened under the auspices of the British Sarcoma Group (BSG) and were intended to provide a framework for the multidisciplinary care of patients with soft tissue sarcomas. This iteration of the guidance, as well as updating the general multidisciplinary management of soft tissue sarcoma, includes specific sections relating to the management of sarcomas at defined anatomical sites: gynaecological sarcomas, retroperitoneal sarcomas, breast sarcomas, and skin sarcomas. These are generally managed collaboratively by site specific multidisciplinary teams linked to the regional sarcoma specialist team, as stipulated in the recently published sarcoma service specification [3]. In the UK, any patient with a suspected soft tissue sarcoma should be referred to a specialist regional soft tissues sarcoma service, to be managed by a specialist sarcoma multidisciplinary team. Once the diagnosis has been confirmed using appropriate imaging and a tissue biopsy, the main modality of management is usually surgical excision performed by a specialist surgeon, combined with pre- or post-operative radiotherapy for tumours at higher risk for local recurrence. Systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) may be utilised in cases where the histological subtype is considered more sensitive to systemic treatment. Regular follow-up is recommended to assess local control, development of metastatic disease, and any late effects of treatment.

    Title: Transcript and protein signatures derived from shared molecular interactions across cancers are associated with mortality.
    Authors: Zhao Y, Li X, Loscalzo J, Smelik M, Sysoev O, Wang Y, Mahmud AKMF, Mansour Aly D, Benson M
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Characterization of shared cancer mechanisms have been proposed to improve therapy strategies and prognosis. Here, we aimed to identify shared cell-cell interactions (CCIs) within the tumor microenvironment across multiple solid cancers and assess their association with cancer mortality. METHODS: CCIs of each cancer were identified by NicheNet analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data from breast, colon, liver, lung, and ovarian cancers. These CCIs were used to construct a shared multi-cellular tumor model (shared-MCTM) representing common CCIs across cancers. A gene signature was identified from the shared-MCTM and tested on the mRNA and protein level in two large independent cohorts: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, 9185 tumor samples and 727 controls across 22 cancers) and UK biobank (UKBB, 10,384 cancer patients and 5063 controls with proteomics data across 17 cancers). Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association of the signature with 10-year all-cause mortality, including sex-specific analysis. RESULTS: A shared-MCTM was derived from five individual cancers. A shared gene signature was extracted from this shared-MCTM and the most prominent regulatory cell type, matrix cancer-associated fibroblast (mCAF). The signature exhibited significant expression changes in multiple cancers compared to controls at both mRNA and protein levels in two independent cohorts. Importantly, it was significantly associated with mortality in cancer patients in both cohorts. The highest hazard ratios were observed for brain cancer in TCGA (HR [95%CI] = 6.90[4.64-10.25]) and ovarian cancer in UKBB (5.53[2.08-8.80]). Sex-specific analysis revealed distinct risks, with a higher mortality risk associated with the protein signature score in males (2.41[1.97-2.96]) compared to females (1.84[1.44-2.37]). CONCLUSION: We identified a gene signature from a comprehensive shared-MCTM representing common CCIs across different cancers and revealed the regulatory role of mCAF in the tumor microenvironment. The pathogenic relevance of the gene signature was supported by differential expression and association with mortality on both mRNA and protein levels in two independent cohorts.

    Title: Survey of awareness and beliefs about cancer (ABC) in Tehran Province, Iran.
    Authors: Akbari P, Nemati S, Nahvijou A, Bolourinejad P, Forbes L, Zendehdel K
    Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Knowledge, attitudes, and practices are essential measures for planning and evaluating cancer control programs. Little is known about these in Iran. METHODS: We conducted a population-based interview survey of adults aged 30-70 using the Farsi version of the Awareness and Beliefs about Cancer questionnaire in the capital province of Tehran, Iran, 2019. We calculated weighted estimates of levels of cancer knowledge, attitudes, and practices to allow for different selection probabilities and nonresponse. We used multivariate logistic regression to understand demographic factors associated with bowel, cervix, and breast screening practices. RESULTS: We interviewed 736 men and 744 women. The mean number of recalled cancer warning signs was less than one; 57.7% could not recall any cancer warning signs. Participants recognized 5.6 out of 11 early cancer warning signs and 8.8 of 13 cancer risk factors. Most (82.7%) did not know that HPV infection was a cancer risk factor. Approximately, half had negative attitudes towards cancer treatment, but over 80% had positive attitudes towards the effectiveness of screening for improving survival. Colorectal, breast, and cervical screening rates were 24%, 42%, and 49%, respectively. Higher socioeconomic status increased the odds of taking up screening for cancer. Women aged 60-70 were less likely to report taking up breast and cervical screening than younger women. DISCUSSION: The Iranian population has poor awareness and negative attitudes about cancer, and participation in screening programs is low. Public awareness and early detection of cancer should be promoted in Iran.

    Title: Erianin inhibits the progression of triple-negative breast cancer by suppressing SRC-mediated cholesterol metabolism.
    Authors: Li M, Kang S, Deng X, Li H, Zhao Y, Tang W, Sheng M
    Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is highly malignant and lacks effective biotherapeutic targets. The development of efficient anticancer drugs with low toxicity and few side effects is a hotspot in TNBC treatment research. Although erianin is known to have potent antitumor activity, its regulatory mechanism and target in TNBC have not been fully elucidated, hampering further drug development. This study showed that erianin can significantly inhibit TNBC cell proliferation and migration, promote cell apoptosis, and inhibit the growth of transplanted tumors in mice. Mechanistically, through network pharmacology analysis, molecular docking and cellular thermal shift assays, we preliminarily identified SRC as the cellular target of erianin. Erianin potently inhibited the expression of SRC, which mediated the anticancer effect of erianin in TNBC. Moreover, erianin can downregulate the expression of genes related to cholesterol synthesis and uptake by targeting SRC, interfering with cholesterol levels in TNBC, thereby inhibiting the progression of TNBC in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, our results suggest that erianin may inhibit the progression of TNBC by suppressing SRC-mediated cholesterol metabolism, and erianin has the great potential to be an effective treatment for TNBC patients.

    Title: Advanced-stage breast cancer diagnosis and its determinants in Ethiopia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
    Authors: Zewdie A, Kassie TD, Anagaw TF, Mazengia EM, Gelaw SS, Fenta ET, Eshetu HB, Kebede N, Bogale EK
    Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Worldwide, breast cancer is the primary cause of illness and death. Unless early detected and treated breast cancer is a life-threatening tumor. Advanced-stage presentation is greatly linked with short survival time and increased mortality rates. In Ethiopia nationally summarized evidence on the level of advanced-stage breast cancer diagnosis is scarce. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the pooled prevalence of advanced-stage breast cancer diagnosis and its determinants in Ethiopia. METHOD: By following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out. To include relevant publications, a broad literature search was conducted in the African Online Journal, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Embase which are published until last search date; June 15, 2023. To prevent further duplication this review was registered in PROSPERO database with ID no of CRD42023435096. To determine the pooled prevalence, a weighted inverse variance random effect model was applied. I(2) statistics and the Cochrane Q-test were computed to determine heterogeneity. To evaluate publication bias, a funnel plot, and Egger's regression test were used. RESULT: A total of 924 articles were sought and finally 20 articles were included in this review. The pooled prevalence of advanced-stage breast cancer diagnosis in Ethiopia was 72.56% (95%CI; 68.46-76.65%). Use of traditional medicine as first choice (AOR = 1.32, 95% CI: (1.13-1.55)), delay of > 3 months in seeking care (AOR = 1.24, 95% CI: (1.09-1.41)), diagnosis or health system delay of > 2 months (AOR = 1.27, 95% CI: (1.11-1.46)), rural residence (AOR = 2.04, 95% CI: (1.42 - 2.92)), and chief complaint of a painless breast lump (AOR = 2.67, 95% CI: (1.76-4.06)) were significantly associated to advanced-stage diagnosis. CONCLUSION: In Ethiopia, more than two-thirds of breast cancer cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Use of traditional medicine before diagnostic confirmation, delay in seeking care, health system delay, rural residence, and chief complaint of painless breast lump were positively associated with an advanced-stage diagnosis. Policymakers and program designers give great focus to those delays so as to seek and access modern diagnosis and treatment as early as possible specifically focusing on those who are rurally residing.

    Title: Metaplastic breast cancer with a unique presentation and complete response to chemotherapy: a case report.
    Authors: Nahhat F, Doyya M, Zabad K, Ksiri H
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Metaplastic breast carcinomas are a rare variant group of breast carcinomas. They are usually high-grade and triple-negative tumors. They often present with large primary tumor sizes. However, the involvement of axillary lymph nodes is infrequent at the time of diagnosis. Metaplastic breast carcinomas are associated with a worse prognosis and a poorer response to chemotherapy in comparison with other non-metaplastic triple-negative breast cancers. Up until this point, there are no specific treatment recommendations for metaplastic breast carcinomas beyond those intended for invasive breast cancer in general. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old woman complained of a palpable mass in her left axilla. On ultrasonography, the mass was solid, spindle-shaped, hypoechoic with regular borders, and exhibited decreased vascularity. At first, the mass appeared to be of a muscular origin. There was not any clinical nor ultrasonic evidence of a primary breast tumor. On magnetic resonance imaging, the axillary mass was a well-defined with regular borders, measuring 24 x 35 mm. Needle biopsy showed a spindle cell tumor with mild to moderate atypia. The subsequent surgical resection revealed a spindle cell neoplasm within a lymph node, favoring a metastatic origin of the tumor. The tumor cells lacked expression of estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors. PET-CT scan indicated pathological uptake in the left breast. Accordingly, the patient was diagnosed with metaplastic breast cancer that had metastasized to the axillary lymph node. She commenced a combined chemotherapy regimen of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. After six treatment cycles, she underwent left modified radical mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection. Pathological examination of the specimens revealed a total burn-out tumor in the breast due to excellent treatment response. There were no residual tumor cells. All dissected lymph nodes were free of tumor. At the one-year follow-up, the patient showed no signs of tumor recurrence. CONCLUSION: This report sheds light on a distinctive presentation of metaplastic breast carcinoma, emphasizing the need for vigilance in diagnosing this rare and aggressive breast cancer variant. In addition, the patient's remarkable response to chemotherapy highlights potential treatment avenues for metaplastic breast cancer.

    Title: Clinical and Imaging Characteristics of Contrast-enhanced Mammography and MRI to Distinguish Microinvasive Carcinoma from Ductal Carcinoma In situ.
    Authors: Hua B, Yang G, An Y, Lou K, Chen J, Quan G, Yuan T
    Abstract: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The prognosis of ductal carcinoma in situ with microinvasion (DCISM) is more similar to that of small invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) than to pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). It is particularly important to accurately distinguish between DCISM and DCIS. The present study aims to compare the clinical and imaging characteristics of contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) between DCISM and pure DCIS, and to identify predictive factors of microinvasive carcinoma, which may contribute to a comprehensive understanding of DCISM in clinical diagnosis and support surveillance strategies, such as surgery, radiation, and other treatment decisions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-seven female patients diagnosed with DCIS were included in the study from May 2019 to August 2023. Patients were further divided into two groups based on pathological diagnosis: DCIS and DCISM. Clinical and imaging characteristics of these two groups were analyzed statistically. The independent clinical risk factors were selected using multivariate logistic regression and used to establish the logistic model [Logit(P)]. The diagnostic performance of independent predictors was assessed and compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and DeLong's test. RESULTS: In CEM, the maximum cross-sectional area (CSAmax), the percentage signal difference between the enhancing lesion and background in the craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique projection (%RSCC, and %RSMLO) were found to be significantly higher for DCISM compared to DCIS (p = 0.001; p < 0.001; p = 0.008). Additionally, there were noticeable statistical differences in the patterns of enhancement morphological distribution (EMD) and internal enhancement pattern (IEP) between DCIS and DCISM (p = 0.047; p = 0.008). In MRI, only CSAmax (p = 0.012) and IEP (p = 0.020) showed significant statistical differences. The multivariate regression analysis suggested that CSAmax (in CEM or MR) and %RSCC were independent predictors of DCISM (all p < 0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) of CSAmax (CEM), %RSCC (CEM), Logit(P) (CEM), and CSAmax (MR) were 0.764, 0.795, 0.842, and 0.739, respectively. There were no significant differences in DeLong's test for these values (all p > 0.10). DCISM was significantly associated with high nuclear grade, comedo type, high axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis, and high Ki-67 positivity compared to DCIS (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The tumor size (CSAmax), enhancement index (%RS), and internal enhancement pattern (IEP) were highly indicative of DCISM. DCISM tends to express more aggressive pathological features, such as high nuclear grade, comedo-type necrosis, ALN metastasis, and Ki-67 overexpression. As with MRI, CEM has the capability to help predict when DCISM is accompanying DCIS.

    Title: Gastrointestinal Toxicity of Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs) in Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Pooled Analysis.
    Authors: Pedersini R, Buffoni M, Petrelli F, Ghidini A, di Mauro P, Amoroso V, Parati MC, Laini L, Cosentini D, Schivardi G, Ippolito G, Berruti A, Lagana M
    Abstract: Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), sacituzumab govitecan (SG), and trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) are three ADCs approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Since gastrointestinal toxicities have been commonly observed with these drugs in clinical trials, a pooled analysis evaluating gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs) in patients with MBC treated with ADCs in clinical trials was performed. PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception until May 2023 for phase II and III clinical trials reporting frequency and severity of gastrointestinal AEs during treatment with ADCs. Data were retrieved for nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain: overall and grade 3-4 toxicity rates according to NCI-CTCAE were collected and expressed as proportions. A pre-specified subgroup analysis according to the agent was also carried out. Fourteen studies, comprising 5608 patients, were included in the analysis. Gastrointestinal AEs were frequently registered with SG and T-DXd. A significantly higher frequency of nausea (65.6% with SG, 75% with T-DXd), vomiting (43.7% with SG, 45% with T-DXd), and diarrhea (59.7% with SG, 29% with T-DXd) was noticed with these ADCs compared to TDM-1. Furthermore, diarrhea was more frequently associated with SG (grade 3 in 7.5% of patients), while constipation and abdominal pain were less common. Gastrointestinal AEs, notably nausea and diarrhea, were frequently reported by MBC patients treated with SG and T-DXd in clinical trials. Since these ADCs are administered continuously until disease progression or occurrence of unbearable AEs, gastrointestinal toxicity may have a negative impact on patient quality of life. Therefore, appropriate management of gastrointestinal AEs is mandatory to ensure treatment efficacy and adherence.

    Title: Doxorubicin encapsulated blend of sitagliptin-lignin polymeric drug delivery system for effective combination therapy against cancer.
    Authors: Liaqat S, Fatima B, Hussain D, Imran M, Zahra Jawad SE, Imran M, Saeed A, Majeed S, Najam-Ul-Haq M
    Abstract: In this research, a sitagliptin-lignin biopolymer (SL) containing zinc selenide quantum dots (ZnSe QDs) and doxorubicin (doxo) was synthesized. The fabricated polymeric drug delivery system was characterized via FTIR, XRD, SEM, TGA, IR, and DSC. SLQD-Doxo exhibited an irregular surface with a 32â€¯nm diameter and well-defined surface chemistry. Drug loading efficiency was assessed at different concentrations, pH levels, time intervals, and temperatures, and drug kinetics were calculated. Maximum drug release was observed at 6â€¯mumol concentration after 24â€¯h, pH of 6.5 and 45â€¯ degrees C. The maximum drug encapsulation efficiency was 81.75â€¯%. SLQD-Doxo demonstrated 24.4â€¯+/-â€¯1.04â€¯% anti-inflammatory activity, and the maximum lipoxygenase inhibition in a concentration-dependent manner was 71.45â€¯+/-â€¯2.02â€¯%, compared to indomethacin, a standard anticancer drug. The designed system was applied to breast cancer MCF-7 cells to evaluate anticancer activity. Cytotoxicity of SLQD-Doxo resulted in 24.48â€¯+/-â€¯1.64 dead cells and 74.39â€¯+/-â€¯4.12 viable cells. Lignin's polyphenolic nature resulted in good antioxidant activity of LLQD-Doxo. The combination of SLQD-Doxo was appropriate for drug delivery at high temperatures and acidic pH of tumor cells compared to healthy cells.

    Title: Preparation, characterization and evaluation of HPbetaCD-PTX/PHB nanoparticles for pH-responsive, cytotoxic and apoptotic properties.
    Authors: Aslam A, Masood F, Perveen K, Berger MR, Pervaiz A, Zepp M, Klika KD, Yasin T, Hameed A
    Abstract: Paclitaxel (PTX) is a potent anticancer drug. However, PTX exhibits extremely poor solubility in aqueous solution along with severe side effects. Therefore, in this study, an inclusion complex was prepared between PTX and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPbetaCD) by solvent evaporation to enhance the drug's solubility. The HPbetaCD-PTX inclusion complex was then encapsulated in poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) to fabricate drug-loaded nanoparticles (HPbetaCD-PTX/PHB NPs) by nanoprecipitation. The HPbetaCD-PTX/PHB NPs depicted a higher release of PTX at pHâ€¯5.5 thus demonstrating a pH-dependent release profile. The cytotoxic properties of HPbetaCD-PTX/PHB NPs were tested against MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and SW-620 cell lines. The cytotoxic potential of HPbetaCD-PTX/PHB NPs was 2.59-fold improved in MCF-7 cells in comparison to free PTX. Additionally, the HPbetaCD-PTX/PHB NPs improved the antimitotic (1.68-fold) and apoptotic (8.45-fold) effects of PTX in MCF-7 cells in comparison to PTX alone. In summary, these pH-responsive nanoparticles could be prospective carriers for enhancing the cytotoxic properties of PTX for the treatment of breast cancer.

    Title: A review concerning the breast cancer-related tumour microenvironment.
    Authors: Rodriguez-Bejarano OH, Parra-Lopez C, Patarroyo MA
    Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) is currently the most common malignant tumour in women and one of the leading causes of their death around the world. New and increasingly personalised diagnostic and therapeutic tools have been introduced over the last few decades, along with significant advances regarding the study and knowledge related to BC. The tumour microenvironment (TME) refers to the tumour cell-associated cellular and molecular environment which can influence conditions affecting tumour development and progression. The TME is composed of immune cells, stromal cells, extracellular matrix (ECM) and signalling molecules secreted by these different cell types. Ever deeper understanding of TME composition changes during tumour development and progression will enable new and more innovative therapeutic strategies to become developed for targeting tumours during specific stages of its evolution. This review summarises the role of BC-related TME components and their influence on tumour progression and the development of resistance to therapy.

    Title: Metal organic framework-based polymeric hydrogel: A promising drug delivery vehicle for the treatment of breast cancer.
    Authors: Pandya I, Kumar S, Aswal VK, El Seoud O, Assiri MA, Malek N
    Abstract: The constraints associated with current cancer therapies have inspired scientists to develop advanced, precise, and safe drug delivery methods. These delivery systems boost treatment effectiveness, minimize harm to healthy cells, and combat cancer recurrence. To design advanced drug delivery vehicle with these character, in the present manuscript, we have designed a self-healing and injectable hybrid hydrogel through synergistically interacting metal organic framework, CuBTC with the poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). This hybrid hydrogel acts as a localized drug delivery system and was used to encapsulate and release the anticancer drug 5-Fluorouracil selectively at the targeted site in response to the physiological pH. The hydrogel was formed through transforming the gaussian coil like matrix of PVA-CuBTC into a three-dimensional network of hydrogel upon the addition of crosslinker; borax. The biocompatible character of the hydrogel was confirmed through cell viability test. The biocompatible hybrid hydrogel then was used to encapsulate and studied for the pH responsive release behavior of the anti-cancer drug, 5-FU. The in vitro cytotoxicity of the drug-loaded hydrogel was evaluated against MCF-7 and HeLa cells. The study confirms that the hybrid hydrogel is effective for targeted and sustained release of anticancer drugs at cancer sites.

    Title: Empagliflozin drives ferroptosis in anoikis-resistant cells by activating miR-128-3p dependent pathway and inhibiting CD98hc in breast cancer.
    Authors: Nalla LV, Khairnar A
    Abstract: A tumour suppressor miRNA, miR-128-3p, is widely involved in various biological processes and has been found to get downregulated in breast cancer patients. We previously published that ectopically expressed miR-128-3p suppressed migration, invasion, cell cycle arrest, and breast cancer stem cells. In the present study, we explored the role of Empagliflozin (EMPA) as a miR-128-3p functionality-mimicking drug in inducing ferroptosis by inhibiting CD98hc. Given that CD98hc is one of the proteins critical in triggering ferroptosis, we confirmed that miR-128-3p and EMPA inhibited SP1, leading to inhibition of CD98hc expression. Further, transfection with siCD98hc, miR-128-3p mimics, and inhibitors was performed to assess their involvement in the ferroptosis of anoikis-resistant cells. We proved that anoikis-resistant cells possess high ROS and iron levels. Further, miR-128-3p and EMPA treatments induced ferroptosis by inhibiting GSH and enzymatic activity of GPX4 and also induced lipid peroxidation. Moreover, EMPA suppressed bioluminescence of 4T1-Red-FLuc induced thoracic cavity, peritoneal tumour burden and lung nodules in an in vivo metastatic model of breast cancer. Collectively, we revealed that EMPA sensitized the ECM detached cells to ferroptosis by synergically activating miR-128-3p and lowering the levels of SP1 and CD98hc, making it a potential adjunct drug for breast cancer chemotherapy.

    Title: Literature review on the bilateral occurrence of invasive lobular breast cancer.
    Authors: Verboven G, Lodewijkx I, Van den Bosch L, Huizing M, Van Goethem M, Broeckx G, Tjalma WA
    Abstract: Historically, it has been believed that invasive lobular carcinomas (ILC) occur more frequently bilaterally compared to other invasive subtypes, with estimates ranging between 20% and 29%. This study aims to determine if this historical perspective still holds true. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to examine the bilateral occurrence of lobular carcinoma using various imaging methods. Additionally, the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detecting contralateral carcinomas was also investigated. A comprehensive search was conducted in the MedLine database on the PubMed platform, resulting in 307 articles published between January 1, 2014, and January 1, 2023. Various selection criteria were applied to identify articles relevant to the research question. After careful assessment, eight articles remained that met the eligibility criteria, all of which provided level-three evidence and were therefore included in the literature review. A total of 599 patients were included in this review, comprising a total of 602 cases of ILC. Six out of the eight articles reviewed provided information on the bilateral occurrence of ILC based on histopathology. A weighted average calculation yielded a bilaterality percentage of 4.95% (24 out of 485 cases). Four articles reported the number of bilateral cases identified through MRI, resulting in a weighted average of 10.2% (26 out of 255 cases). It is worth noting that 20.4% (100 out of 491) of the performed MRIs were found to be either useless or even harmful. Furthermore, MRI led to a change in the treatment plan in 27.7% (136 out of 491) of cases. Overall, it can be concluded that there is limited available data regarding the bilateral occurrence of ILC. The numbers found in the literature are also inconsistent and tend to vary. The literature review revealed a decrease in the percentage of bilaterality compared to historical beliefs. Based on this study, it can be concluded that a high number of MRI scans were found to be either useless or harmful. As a result of this conclusion and a higher sensitivity of other screening modalities, MRI may no longer be indicated as part of the standard workup for ILC. However, further research is necessary to validate these findings.

    Title: Cryopreservation of ovarian tissue for fertility preservation in breast cancer patients: time to stop?
    Authors: Macklon KT, De Vos M
    Abstract: Fertility preservation is currently offered to young women with breast cancer to increase their chances of motherhood after a potentially gonadotoxic treatment. Ovarian stimulation with oocyte vitrification and cryopreservation of ovarian tissue remain the most commonly used methods of choice. Whichever method is preferred is very much dependent on the practice and experience of the clinics, although for breast cancer in particular one method might be superior to the other. Cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is inevitably associated with the iatrogenic reduction of the ovarian reserve of a patient and should only be offered to women with a high risk of premature ovarian insufficiency following treatment. However, for younger breast cancer survivors, pregnancy and delivery rates are reassuringly high, even after chemotherapy. Despite its widespread use, few women come back to make use of their cryopreserved tissue. It is argued here that cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is not an appropriate option for breast cancer patients and discuss the reasons for this opinion.

    Title: Cholesteryl ester transfer protein knock-down in conjunction with a cholesterol-depleting agent decreases tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells.
    Authors: Gu L, Pillay RP, Aronson R, Kaur M
    Abstract: The cholesterogenic phenotype, encompassing de novo biosynthesis and accumulation of cholesterol, aids cancer cell proliferation and survival. Previously, the role of cholesteryl ester (CE) transfer protein (CETP) has been implicated in breast cancer aggressiveness, but the molecular basis of this observation is not clearly understood, which this study aims to elucidate. CETP knock-down resulted in a >50% decrease in cell proliferation in both 'estrogen receptor-positive' (ER+; Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF7) breast cancer cells) and 'triple-negative' breast cancer (TNBC; MDA-MB-231) cell lines. Intriguingly, the abrogation of CETP together with the combination treatment of tamoxifen (5 muM) and acetyl plumbagin (a cholesterol-depleting agent) (5 muM) resulted in twofold to threefold increase in apoptosis in both cell lines. CETP knockdown also showed decreased intracellular CE levels, lipid raft and lipid droplets in both cell lines. In addition, RT(2) Profiler PCR array (Qiagen, Germany)-based gene expression analysis revealed an overall downregulation of genes associated in cholesterol biosynthesis, lipid signalling and drug resistance in MCF7 cells post-CETP knock-down. On the contrary, resistance in MDA-MB-231 cells was reduced through increased expression in cholesterol efflux genes and the expression of targetable surface receptors by endocrine therapy. The pilot xenograft mice study substantiated CETP's role as a cancer survival gene as knock-down of CETP stunted the growth of TNBC tumour by 86%. The principal findings of this study potentiate CETP as a driver in breast cancer growth and aggressiveness and thus targeting CETP could limit drug resistance via the reduction in cholesterol accumulation in breast cancer cells, thereby reducing cancer aggressiveness.

    Title: GEnDDn: An lncRNA-Disease Association Identification Framework Based on Dual-Net Neural Architecture and Deep Neural Network.
    Authors: Peng L, Ren M, Huang L, Chen M
    Abstract: Accumulating studies have demonstrated close relationships between long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and diseases. Identification of new lncRNA-disease associations (LDAs) enables us to better understand disease mechanisms and further provides promising insights into cancer targeted therapy and anti-cancer drug design. Here, we present an LDA prediction framework called GEnDDn based on deep learning. GEnDDn mainly comprises two steps: First, features of both lncRNAs and diseases are extracted by combining similarity computation, non-negative matrix factorization, and graph attention auto-encoder, respectively. And each lncRNA-disease pair (LDP) is depicted as a vector based on concatenation operation on the extracted features. Subsequently, unknown LDPs are classified by aggregating dual-net neural architecture and deep neural network. Using six different evaluation metrics, we found that GEnDDn surpassed four competing LDA identification methods (SDLDA, LDNFSGB, IPCARF, LDASR) on the lncRNADisease and MNDR databases under fivefold cross-validation experiments on lncRNAs, diseases, LDPs, and independent lncRNAs and independent diseases, respectively. Ablation experiments further validated the powerful LDA prediction performance of GEnDDn. Furthermore, we utilized GEnDDn to find underlying lncRNAs for lung cancer and breast cancer. The results elucidated that there may be dense linkages between IFNG-AS1 and lung cancer as well as between HIF1A-AS1 and breast cancer. The results require further biomedical experimental verification. GEnDDn is publicly available at https://github.com/plhhnu/GEnDDn.

    Title: The response of pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma to platinum and olaparib therapy in a germline BRCA2 variant carrier: case report and literature review.
    Authors: Matsubayashi H, Todaka A, Tsushima T, Kiyozumi Y, Harada R, Ishihara E, Higashigawa S, Ohike N, Sakamoto H, Sato J, Ishiwatari H, Sugiura T, Uesaka K
    Abstract: A 73-year-old Japanese man with a history of distal biliary cancer treated by pancreatoduodenectomy developed pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (PACC) treated by remnant pancreatectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy. Thirteen months after surgery, multiple liver metastases developed and FOLFOX chemotherapy was initiated. Based on the PACC diagnosis and a positive family history for breast and ovarian cancer genetic testing was performed which revealed a pathogenic germline BRCA2 variant (c.8629G > T, p.Glu2877Ter). Olaparib therapy was initiated and the metastases responded well (partial response). PACC is a BRCA2-associated cancer which may respond well to PARP inhibitors.

    Title: Ultrasensitive and Rapid Circulating Tumor DNA Liquid Biopsy Using Surface-Confined Gene Amplification on Dispersible Magnetic Nano-Electrodes.
    Authors: Park BC, Soh JO, Choi HJ, Park HS, Lee SM, Fu HE, Kim MS, Ko MJ, Koo TM, Lee JY, Kim YK, Lee JH
    Abstract: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) detection has been acknowledged as a promising liquid biopsy approach for cancer diagnosis, with various ctDNA assays used for early detection and treatment monitoring. Dispersible magnetic nanoparticle-based electrochemical detection methods have been proposed as promising candidates for ctDNA detection based on the detection performance and features of the platform material. This study proposes a nanoparticle surface-localized genetic amplification approach by integrating Fe(3)O(4)-Au core-shell nanoparticles into polymerase chain reactions (PCR). These highly dispersible and magnetically responsive superparamagnetic nanoparticles act as nano-electrodes that amplify and accumulate target ctDNA in situ on the nanoparticle surface upon PCR amplification. These nanoparticles are subsequently captured and subjected to repetitive electrochemical measurements to induce reconfiguration-mediated signal amplification for ultrasensitive ( approximately 3 aM) and rapid ( approximately 7 min) metastatic breast cancer ctDNA detection in vitro. The detection platform can also detect metastatic biomarkers from in vivo samples, highlighting the potential for clinical applications and further expansion to rapid and ultrasensitive multiplex detection of various cancers.

    Title: Impact of obesity on sentinel lymph node biopsy outcomes and survival in breast cancer patients: A single-center retrospective study.
    Authors: Pang J, Li L, Yin N, Dai M, Zheng S, Chen M, Xue J, Wu J
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a common choice for axillary surgery in patients with early-stage breast cancer (BC) who have clinically negative lymph nodes. Most research indicates that obesity is a prognostic factor for BC patients, but studies assessing its association with the rate of positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) and the prognosis of patients with early BC undergoing SLNB are limited. METHODS: Between 2013 and 2016, 7062 early-stage BC patients from the Shanghai Cancer Center of Fudan University were included. Based on the Chinese Body Mass Index (BMI) classification standards, the patients were divided into three groups as follows: normal weight, overweight, and obese. Propensity score matching analysis was used to balance the baseline characteristics of the participants. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between obesity and positive SLN rate. Cox regression analysis was used to investigate whether obesity was an independent prognostic factor for early-stage BC patients who had undergone SLNB. RESULTS: No significant association was observed between obesity and positive SLN rate in early-stage BC patients who had undergone SLNB. However, multivariate analysis revealed that compared to patients with normal BMI, the overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 2.240, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27-3.95, p = 0.005) and disease-free survival (HR 1.750, 95% CI 1.16-2.62, p = 0.007) were poorer in patients with high BMI. CONCLUSION: Obesity is an independent prognostic factor for early-stage BC patients who undergo SLNB; however, it does not affect the positive SLN rate.

    Title: Trastuzumab deruxtecan in previously treated HER2-positive metastatic or unresectable breast cancer: Real-life data from the temporary use authorization program in France.
    Authors: Petit T, Hajjaji N, Antoine EC, Benderra MA, Gozy M, Foa C, Mouysset JL, Grenier J, Mousseau M, Mailliez A, Saghatchian M, Lachaier E, Desmoulins I, Hennequin A, Maes P, Loirat D, Ricci F, Dieras V, Berton D, Tiong FL, Teixeira L, Dohollou N, Levy C, Bachelot T, Pierga JY
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Early access program (formerly cohort Temporary Authorization for Use) was granted for trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) in France based on DESTINY-Breast01 trial which demonstrated its efficacy and safety in HER2-positive metastatic/unresectable breast cancer after >/=2 anti-HER2-based regimens received at metastatic stage. METHODS: This multicenter real-world early access program included HER2-positive metastatic/unresectable breast patients pretreated with at least two lines of anti-HER2 regimens who received T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg intravenously in monotherapy every 3 weeks. RESULTS: Four hundred and fifty-nine patients (median age, 58 years; hormone receptor-positive, 67%; brain metastases, 28.1%) received T-DXd. Before inclusion, 81.7% of patients had radiation therapy and 76.5% had undergone surgery. Median number of prior metastatic treatment lines was four (range, 2-22); 99.8% patients had received trastuzumab, 94.8% trastuzumab emtansine and 79.3% pertuzumab. Follow-up was performed from September 30, 2020 to March 30, 2021; when the early access program stopped, the median duration of T-DXd treatment was 3.4 (range, 0-7.8) months. In 160 patients with available tumor assessment, objective response rate was 56.7% and 12.1% had progression. In 57 patients with available brain tumor assessment, complete or partial intracranial response was reported for 35.7% patients and 5.4% had progression. A total of 17 (3.7%) patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) was reported with no cases of ILD-related death. CONCLUSIONS: In this early access program in patients with heavily pretreated HER2-positive metastatic/unresectable breast cancer, T-DXd had antitumor activity with a similar response to that reported in previous clinical studies. T-DXd was well tolerated and no new safety signals were observed.

    Title: Improvement of Phased Antenna Array Applied in Focused Microwave Breast Hyperthermia.
    Authors: Wang X, Xi Z, Ye K, Gong Z, Chen Y, Wang X
    Abstract: Focused microwave breast hyperthermia (FMBH) employs a phased antenna array to perform beamforming that can focus microwave energy at targeted breast tumors. Selective heating of the tumor endows the hyperthermia treatment with high accuracy and low side effects. The effect of FMBH is highly dependent on the applied phased antenna array. This work investigates the effect of polarizations of antenna elements on the microwave-focusing results by simulations. We explore two kinds of antenna arrays with the same number of elements using different digital realistic human breast phantoms. The first array has all the elements' polarization in the vertical plane of the breast, while the second array has half of the elements' polarization in the vertical plane and the other half in the transverse plane, i.e., cross polarization. In total, 96 sets of different simulations are performed, and the results show that the second array leads to a better focusing effect in dense breasts than the first array. This work is very meaningful for the potential improvement of the antenna array for FMBH, which is of great significance for the future clinical applications of FMBH. The antenna array with cross polarization can also be applied in microwave imaging and sensing for biomedical applications.

    Title: Advancing Evidence Generation for Circulating Tumor DNA: Lessons Learned from A Multi-Assay Study of Baseline Circulating Tumor DNA Levels across Cancer Types and Stages.

    Abstract: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) holds promise as a biomarker for predicting clinical responses to therapy in solid tumors, and multiple ctDNA assays are in development. However, the heterogeneity in ctDNA levels prior to treatment (baseline) across different cancer types and stages and across ctDNA assays has not been widely studied. Friends of Cancer Research formed a collaboration across multiple commercial ctDNA assay developers to assess baseline ctDNA levels across five cancer types in early- and late-stage disease. This retrospective study included eight commercial ctDNA assay developers providing summary-level de-identified data for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), bladder, breast, prostate, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma following a common analysis protocol. Baseline ctDNA levels across late-stage cancer types were similarly detected, highlighting the potential use of ctDNA as a biomarker in these cancer types. Variability was observed in ctDNA levels across assays in early-stage NSCLC, indicative of the contribution of assay analytical performance and methodology on variability. We identified key data elements, including assay characteristics and clinicopathological metadata, that need to be standardized for future meta-analyses across multiple assays. This work facilitates evidence generation opportunities to support the use of ctDNA as a biomarker for clinical response.

    Title: Exploring CDKN1A Upregulation Mechanisms: Insights into Cell Cycle Arrest Induced by NC2603 Curcumin Analog in MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells.
    Authors: Nishimura FG, Sampaio BB, Komoto TT, da Silva WJ, da Costa MMG, Haddad GI, Peronni KC, Evangelista AF, Hossain M, Dimmock JR, Bandy B, Beleboni RO, Marins M, Fachin AL
    Abstract: Breast cancer stands out as one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, necessitating a nuanced understanding of its molecular underpinnings for effective treatment. Hormone receptors in breast cancer cells substantially influence treatment strategies, dictating therapeutic approaches in clinical settings, serving as a guide for drug development, and aiming to enhance treatment specificity and efficacy. Natural compounds, such as curcumin, offer a diverse array of chemical structures with promising therapeutic potential. Despite curcumin's benefits, challenges like poor solubility and rapid metabolism have spurred the exploration of analogs. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of the curcumin analog NC2603 to induce cell cycle arrest in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and explored its molecular mechanisms. Our findings reveal potent inhibition of cell viability (IC50 = 5.6 muM) and greater specificity than doxorubicin toward MCF-7 vs. non-cancer HaCaT cells. Transcriptome analysis identified 12,055 modulated genes, most notably upregulation of GADD45A and downregulation of ESR1, implicating CDKN1A-mediated regulation of proliferation and cell cycle genes. We hypothesize that the curcumin analog by inducing GADD45A expression and repressing ESR1, triggers the expression of CDKN1A, which in turn downregulates the expression of many important genes of proliferation and the cell cycle. These insights advance our understanding of curcumin analogs' therapeutic potential, highlighting not just their role in treatment, but also the molecular pathways involved in their activity toward breast cancer cells.

    Title: A Nanorobotics-Based Approach of Breast Cancer in the Nanotechnology Era.
    Authors: Neagu AN, Jayaweera T, Weraduwage K, Darie CC
    Abstract: We are living in an era of advanced nanoscience and nanotechnology. Numerous nanomaterials, culminating in nanorobots, have demonstrated ingenious applications in biomedicine, including breast cancer (BC) nano-theranostics. To solve the complicated problem of BC heterogeneity, non-targeted drug distribution, invasive diagnostics or surgery, resistance to classic onco-therapies and real-time monitoring of tumors, nanorobots are designed to perform multiple tasks at a small scale, even at the organelles or molecular level. Over the last few years, most nanorobots have been bioengineered as biomimetic and biocompatible nano(bio)structures, resembling different organisms and cells, such as urchin, spider, octopus, fish, spermatozoon, flagellar bacterium or helicoidal cyanobacterium. In this review, readers will be able to deepen their knowledge of the structure, behavior and role of several types of nanorobots, among other nanomaterials, in BC theranostics. We summarized here the characteristics of many functionalized nanodevices designed to counteract the main neoplastic hallmark features of BC, from sustaining proliferation and evading anti-growth signaling and resisting programmed cell death to inducing angiogenesis, activating invasion and metastasis, preventing genomic instability, avoiding immune destruction and deregulating autophagy. Most of these nanorobots function as targeted and self-propelled smart nano-carriers or nano-drug delivery systems (nano-DDSs), enhancing the efficiency and safety of chemo-, radio- or photodynamic therapy, or the current imagistic techniques used in BC diagnosis. Most of these nanorobots have been tested in vitro, using various BC cell lines, as well as in vivo, mainly based on mice models. We are still waiting for nanorobots that are low-cost, as well as for a wider transition of these favorable effects from laboratory to clinical practice.

    Title: Micronutrient Status and Breast Cancer: A Narrative Review.
    Authors: Forma A, Grunwald A, Zembala P, Januszewski J, Brachet A, Zembala R, Swiatek K, Baj J
    Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, at the same time being one of the most prevalent causes of women's death. Many factors such as alcohol, weight fluctuations, or hormonal replacement therapy can potentially contribute to breast cancer development and progression. Another important factor in breast cancer onset includes micronutrient status. In this narrative review, we analyzed 23 micronutrients and their possible influence on breast cancer onset and progression. Further, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of micronutrient status on the prevention of breast cancer and its possible influence on various therapeutic pathways. We researched meta-analyses, systemic and narrative reviews, retrospective studies, as well as original studies on human and animal models. The results of these studies indicate a possible correlation between the different levels of micronutrients and a decreased risk of breast cancer as well as a better survival rate. However, further studies are necessary to establish adequate doses of supplementation of the chosen micronutrients and the exact mechanisms of micronutrient impact on breast cancer therapy.

    Title: Anticancer Effects of Mitoquinone via Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis in Canine Mammary Gland Tumor Cells.
    Authors: Lee R, Lee WY, Park HJ
    Abstract: Treating female canine mammary gland tumors is crucial owing to their propensity for rapid progression and metastasis, significantly impacting the overall health and well-being of dogs. Mitoquinone (MitoQ), an antioxidant, has shown promise in inhibiting the migration, invasion, and clonogenicity of human breast cancer cells. Thus, we investigated MitoQ's potential anticancer properties against canine mammary gland tumor cells, CMT-U27 and CF41.Mg. MitoQ markedly suppressed the proliferation and migration of both CMT-U27 and CF41.Mg cells and induced apoptotic cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, treatment with MitoQ led to increased levels of pro-apoptotic proteins, including cleaved-caspase3, BAX, and phospho-p53. Cell cycle analysis revealed that MitoQ hindered cell progression in the G1 and S phases in CMT-U27 and CF41.Mg cells. These findings were supported using western blot analysis, demonstrating elevated levels of cleaved caspase-3, a hallmark of apoptosis, and decreased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2 and cyclin D4, pivotal regulators of the cell cycle. In conclusion, MitoQ exhibits in vitro antitumor effects by inducing apoptosis and arresting the cell cycle in canine mammary gland tumors, suggesting its potential as a preventive or therapeutic agent against canine mammary cancer.

    Title: Clinical and Biologic Correlates of ADORA2A Transcriptomic Expression in Cancer.
    Authors: Shreenivas A, Nishizaki D, Lee S, Pabla S, Nesline M, Conroy JM, DePietro P, Kato S, Kurzrock R
    Abstract: ADORA2A (adenosine A2a receptor) and ADORA2B propagate immunoregulatory signals, including restricting both innate and adaptive immunity, though recent data also suggest a tumor suppressor effect in certain settings. We evaluated the RNA expression from 514 tumors in a clinical-grade laboratory; 489 patients with advanced/metastatic disease had clinical outcome correlates. Transcript expression was standardized to internal housekeeping genes and ranked (0-100 scale) relative to 735 specimens from 35 different cancer types. Transcript abundance rank values were defined as "low/moderate" (0-74) or "high" (75-100) percentile RNA expression ranks. Overall, 20.8% of tumors had high ADORA2A (>/=75 percentile RNA rank). The greatest proportion of high ADORA2A expressors was found in neuroendocrine and breast cancers and sarcomas, whereas the lowest was found in colorectal and ovarian cancers, albeit with patient-to-patient variability. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, there was a significant positive correlation between high ADORA2A RNA expression and a high expression of the immune checkpoint-related molecules PD-1 (p = 0.015), VISTA (p </= 0.001), CD38 (p = 0.031), and CD39 (p </= 0.001). In 217 immunotherapy-treated patients, high ADORA2A did not correlate significantly with progression-free (p = 0.51) or overall survival (OS) (p = 0.09) from the initiation of the checkpoint blockade. However, high versus not-high ADORA2A transcript expression correlated with longer OS from the time of advanced/metastatic disease (N = 489 patients; (HR 0.69 (95% CI 0.51-0.95) (p = 0.02)). Therefore, high ADORA2A transcript levels may be a favorable prognostic factor, unrelated to immunotherapy. Importantly, ascertaining co-expression patterns of ADORA2A with PD-1 and VISTA in individual tumors as a basis for the precision co-targeting of ADORA2A and these other checkpoint-related molecules warrants investigation in clinical trials.

    Title: Type II Interleukin-4 Receptor Activation in Basal Breast Cancer Cells Promotes Tumor Progression via Metabolic and Epigenetic Modulation.
    Authors: Williams D, Hargrove-Wiley E, Bindeman W, Valent D, Miranda AX, Beckstead J, Fingleton B
    Abstract: Interleukin-4 (IL4) is a Th2 cytokine that can signal through two different receptors, one of which-the type II receptor-is overexpressed by various cancer cells. Previously, we have shown that type II IL4 receptor signaling increases proliferation and metastasis in mouse models of breast cancer, as well as increasing glucose and glutamine metabolism. Here, we expand on those findings to determine mechanistically how IL4 signaling links glucose metabolism and histone acetylation to drive proliferation in the context of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We used a combination of cellular, biochemical, and genomics approaches to interrogate TNBC cell lines, which represent a cancer type where high expression of the type II IL4 receptor is linked to reduced survival. Our results indicate that type II IL4 receptor activation leads to increased glucose uptake, Akt and ACLY activation, and histone acetylation in TNBC cell lines. Inhibition of glucose uptake through the deletion of Glut1 ablates IL4-induced proliferation. Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of histone acetyltransferase P300 attenuates IL4-mediated gene expression and proliferation in vitro. Our work elucidates a role for type II IL4 receptor signaling in promoting TNBC progression, and highlights type II IL4 signaling, as well as histone acetylation, as possible targets for therapy.

    Title: Biological Roles and Clinical Applications of Exosomes in Breast Cancer: A Brief Review.
    Authors: Wang H, Wang R, Shen K, Huang R, Wang Z
    Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) is a global health risk for women and has a high prevalence rate. The drug resistance, recurrence, and metastasis of BC affect patient prognosis, thus posing a challenge to scientists. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles (EVs) that originate from various cells; they have a double-layered lipid membrane structure and contain rich biological information. They mediate intercellular communication and have pivotal roles in tumor development, progression, and metastasis and drug resistance. Exosomes are important cell communication mediators in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Exosomes are utilized as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for estimating the treatment efficacy of BC and have the potential to function as tools to enable the targeted delivery of antitumor drugs. This review introduces recent progress in research on how exosomes influence tumor development and the TME. We also present the research progress on the application of exosomes as prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers and drug delivery tools.

    Title: BMP Stimulation Differentially Affects Phosphorylation and Protein Stability of beta-Catenin in Breast Cancer Cell Lines.
    Authors: Ilhan M, Hastar N, Kampfrath B, Spierling DN, Jatzlau J, Knaus P
    Abstract: Increased expression and nuclear translocation of beta-CATENIN is frequently observed in breast cancer, and it correlates with poor prognosis. Current treatment strategies targeting beta-CATENIN are not as efficient as desired. Therefore, detailed understanding of beta-CATENIN regulation is crucial. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) and Wingless/Integrated (WNT) pathway crosstalk is well-studied for many cancer types including colorectal cancer, whereas it is still poorly understood for breast cancer. Analysis of breast cancer patient data revealed that BMP2 and BMP6 were significantly downregulated in tumors. Since mutation frequency in genes enhancing beta-CATENIN protein stability is relatively low in breast cancer, we aimed to investigate whether decreased BMP ligand expression could contribute to a high protein level of beta-CATENIN in breast cancer cells. We demonstrated that downstream of BMP stimulation, SMAD4 is required to reduce beta-CATENIN protein stability through the phosphorylation in MCF7 and T47D cells. Consequently, BMP stimulation reduces beta-CATENIN levels and prevents its nuclear translocation and target gene expression in MCF7 cells. Conversely, BMP stimulation has no effect on beta-CATENIN phosphorylation or stability in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. Likewise, SMAD4 modulation does not alter the response of those cells, indicating that SMAD4 alone is insufficient for BMP-induced beta-CATENIN phosphorylation. While our data suggest that considering BMP activity may serve as a prognostic marker for understanding beta-CATENIN accumulation risk, further investigation is needed to elucidate the differential responsiveness of breast cancer cell lines.

    Title: Antioxidant and Cytotoxic Properties of Berberis vulgaris (L.) Stem Bark Dry Extract.
    Authors: Ivan IM, Olaru OT, Popovici V, Chitescu CL, Popescu L, Luta EA, Ilie EI, Brasoveanu LI, Hotnog CM, Nitulescu GM, Boscencu R, Gird CE
    Abstract: Berberis vulgaris (L.) has remarkable ethnopharmacological properties and is widely used in traditional medicine. The present study investigated B. vulgaris stem bark (Berberidis cortex) by extraction with 50% ethanol. The main secondary metabolites were quantified, resulting in a polyphenols content of 17.6780 +/- 3.9320 mg Eq tannic acid/100 g extract, phenolic acids amount of 3.3886 +/- 0.3481 mg Eq chlorogenic acid/100 g extract and 78.95 microg/g berberine. The dried hydro-ethanolic extract (BVE) was thoroughly analyzed using Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled with High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS/MS) and HPLC, and 40 bioactive phenolic constituents were identified. Then, the antioxidant potential of BVE was evaluated using three methods. Our results could explain the protective effects of Berberidis cortex EC(50)FRAP = 0.1398 mg/mL, IC(50)ABTS = 0.0442 mg/mL, IC(50)DPPH = 0.2610 mg/mL compared to ascorbic acid (IC(50) = 0.0165 mg/mL). Next, the acute toxicity and teratogenicity of BVE and berberine-berberine sulfate hydrate (BS)-investigated on Daphnia sp. revealed significant BS toxicity after 24 h, while BVE revealed considerable toxicity after 48 h and induced embryonic developmental delays. Finally, the anticancer effects of BVE and BS were evaluated in different tumor cell lines after 24 and 48 h of treatments. The MTS assay evidenced dose- and time-dependent antiproliferative activity, which was higher for BS than BVE. The strongest diminution of tumor cell viability was recorded in the breast (MDA-MB-231), colon (LoVo) cancer, and OSCC (PE/CA-PJ49) cell lines after 48 h of exposure (IC(50) < 100 microg/mL). However, no cytotoxicity was reported in the normal epithelial cells (HUVEC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HT-29) cell lines. Extensive data analysis supports our results, showing a significant correlation between the BVE concentration, phenolic compounds content, antioxidant activity, exposure time, and the viability rate of various normal cells and cancer cell lines.

    Title: Splenic Elemental Composition of Breast Cancer-Suffering Rats Supplemented with Pomegranate Seed Oil and Bitter Melon Extract.
    Authors: Bialek M, Lepionka T, Wojtak W, Ruszczynska A, Bulska E, Czauderna M, Bialek A
    Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate how dietary modifications with pomegranate seed oil (PSO) and bitter melon aqueous extract (BME) affect mineral content in the spleen of rats both under normal physiological conditions and with coexisting mammary tumorigenesis. The diet of Sprague-Dawley female rats was supplemented either with PSO or with BME, or with a combination for 21 weeks. A chemical carcinogen (7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene) was applied intragastrically to induce mammary tumors. In the spleen of rats, the selected elements were determined with a quadrupole mass spectrometer with inductively coupled plasma ionization (ICP-MS). ANOVA was used to evaluate differences in elemental composition among experimental groups. Multivariate statistical methods were used to discover whether some subtle dependencies exist between experimental factors and thus influence the element content. Experimental factors affected the splenic levels of macroelements, except for potassium. Both diet modification and the cancerogenic process resulted in significant changes in the content of Fe, Se, Co, Cr, Ni, Al, Sr, Pb, Cd, B, and Tl in rat spleen. Chemometric analysis revealed the greatest impact of the ongoing carcinogenic process on the mineral composition of the spleen. The obtained results may contribute to a better understanding of peripheral immune organ functioning, especially during the neoplastic process, and thus may help develop anticancer prevention and treatment strategies.

    Title: Echocardiographic Assessment of Left Ventricular Function in Three Oncologic Therapeutic Modalities in Women with Breast Cancer: The ONCO-ECHO Multicenter Study.
    Authors: Gasior T, Zaborska B, Stachowiak P, Sikora-Frac M, Mizia-Stec K, Kasprzak J, Bodys A, Bijoch J, Szmagala A, Kosior DA, Plonska-Gosciniak E
    Abstract: Background: Oncological treatment of breast cancer may be associated with adverse effects on myocardial function. Objectives: The objective of this study was to compare the influence of three oncological treatment methods of intervention on the echocardiographic (ECHO) parameters of left ventricular function. Materials and Methods: One hundred and fifty-five women with breast cancer were divided into three groups depending on the type of therapy used: group I (AC)-anthracyclines; group II (AC + TZ)-anthracyclines + trastuzumab; and group III (RTls+)-anthracyclines with or without trastuzumab + left-sided radiotherapy. Prospective ECHO examinations were performed at baseline and every 3 months, up to 12 months from the start of the therapy. Patients with a history of chemotherapy or who were diagnosed with heart disease were not included in the study. Results: Out of 155 patients, 3 died due to cancer as the primary cause, and 12 withdrew their consent for further observation. Baseline systolic and diastolic ECHO parameters did not differ between the analyzed groups. Cardiotoxicity, according to the LVEF criteria, occurred during follow-up in 20 patients (14.3%), irrespective of the treatment method used. Diastolic echocardiographic parameters did not change significantly after 12 months in each group, except for the left atrial volume index (LAVi), which was significantly higher in the AC + TZ compared to the values in the RTls+ group. Conclusions: All three oncologic therapeutic modalities in women with breast cancer showed no significant differences in relation to the incidence of echocardiographic cardiotoxicity criterion; however, transient systolic decrease in LVEF was most frequently observed in the AC + TZ therapeutic regimen. Left-sided radiotherapy was not associated with excess left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction during a 12-month follow-up period. The predictors of negative changes in diastolic parameters included age and combined anthracycline and trastuzumab therapy.

    Title: Risk of Skin Cancer in Patients with Psoriasis: Single-Center Retrospective Study Comparing Anti-TNFalpha and Phototherapy.
    Authors: Trovato E, Dragotto M, Capalbo E, Cartocci A, Rubegni P, Calabrese L
    Abstract: Background: The risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) in patients with psoriasis is highly debated, and, to date, there is no unambiguous consensus opinion. Psoriasis is known to be related to an increased likelihood of other comorbidities such as psoriatic arthritis, obesity, metabolic syndrome, depression, and cardiovascular disease. Regarding cancer risk, previous studies have reported a greater tendency for the development of cutaneous T-lymphomas and colon, breast, kidney, and lung cancers. Furthermore, data from network meta-analyses have shown that patients with psoriasis have a higher risk of developing squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and/or basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). Multiple factors may contribute to the development of NMSCs in psoriatic patients, ranging from immunosuppression induced by biologic agents to previous phototherapy. However, the extent to which each factor may impact this risk has not been entirely assessed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of developing NMSCs in patients with psoriasis observed for at least 5 years, by directly comparing patients only treated with phototherapy and patients treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) agents, naive to other systemic treatments or phototherapy. Methods: We conducted a single-center retrospective study at Siena University Hospital, Italy, on 200 adult patients with psoriasis divided into two groups: (i) group 1, including 100 patients treated with narrow-band UVB phototherapy (nb-UVB), and (ii) group 2, including 100 patients treated with anti-TNFalpha. The patients included in group 2 had to be naive to cDMARDs and biologics and treated with anti-TNFalpha continuously for 5 years without loss of efficacy. All patients were observed for 5 years and underwent annual dermatologic examinations to assess for the occurrence of BCC or SCC. Results: A total of 34 out of 100 patients treated with phototherapy had one BCC or one SCC and 10 out of 34 developed two skin cancers. In particular, five had both types (one BCC and one SCC), and five had two BCCs. Conclusions: The results of our study highlight how the risk of developing NMSCs is greater in patients undergoing phototherapy compared to those treated with anti-TNFalpha. It also draws attention to the consideration that patients with scalp psoriasis might need closer follow-up as they could be more at risk of developing NMSCs.

    Title: Quantum Dot Research in Breast Cancer: Challenges and Prospects.
    Authors: Omidian H, Wilson RL, Cubeddu LX
    Abstract: The multifaceted role of quantum dots (QDs) in breast cancer research highlights significant advancements in diagnostics, targeted therapy, and drug delivery systems. This comprehensive review addresses the development of precise imaging techniques for early cancer detection and the use of QDs in enhancing the specificity of therapeutic delivery, particularly in challenging cases like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The paper also discusses the critical understanding of QDs' interactions with cancer cells, offering insights into their potential for inducing cytotoxic effects and facilitating gene therapy. Limitations such as biocompatibility, toxicity concerns, and the transition from laboratory to clinical practice are critically analyzed. Future directions emphasize safer, non-toxic QD development, improved targeting mechanisms, and the integration of QDs into personalized medicine, aiming to overcome the current challenges and enhance breast cancer management.

    Title: Real-World Data Analysis of CDK4/6 Inhibitor Therapy-A Patient-Centric Single Center Study.
    Authors: Ge I, Berner K, Mathis M, Hensgen C, Mayer S, Erbes T, Juhasz-Boss I, Asberger J
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: The quest to comprehend the real-world efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDKis) in breast cancer continues, as patient responses vary significantly. METHODS: This single-center retrospective study evaluated CDKi use outside the trial condition from November 2016 to May 2020. Progression-free survival (PFS), time-to-treatment failure (TTF), short-term and prolonged treatment benefit (>/=4 and >/=10 months), as well as prognostic and predictive markers were assessed with Kaplan-Meier and multivariate regression analyses. RESULTS: Out of 86 identified patients, 58 (67.4%) had treatment failure of which 40 (46.5%) were due to progression. Median PFS and TTF were 12 and 8.5 months, respectively. A total of 57 (66.3%) and 42 (48.8%) patients experienced short-term and prolonged treatment benefit. Independent, significant predictors for PFS were progesterone receptor expression (HR: 0.88), multiple metastatic sites (HR: 2.56), and hepatic metastasis (HR: 2.01). Significant predictors for TTF were PR expression (HR: 0.86), multiple sites (HR: 3.29), adverse events (HR: 2.35), and diabetes (HR: 2.88). Aside from tumor biology and adverse events, treatment modifications like pausing and switching of CDKi were predictive for short-term (OR: 6.73) and prolonged (OR: 14.27) therapeutic benefit, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These findings emphasize the importance of tailored treatment strategies, highlighting the role of PR expression, metastatic burden, and therapeutic adjustments in optimizing patient outcomes in real-world breast cancer management.

    Title: Activation of the Anaphase Promoting Complex Restores Impaired Mitotic Progression and Chemosensitivity in Multiple Drug-Resistant Human Breast Cancer.
    Authors: Lubachowski M, VanGenderen C, Valentine S, Belak Z, Davies GF, Arnason TG, Harkness TAA
    Abstract: The development of multiple-drug-resistant (MDR) cancer all too often signals the need for toxic alternative therapy or palliative care. Our recent in vivo and in vitro studies using canine MDR lymphoma cancer cells demonstrate that the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC) is impaired in MDR cells compared to normal canine control and drug-sensitive cancer cells. Here, we sought to establish whether this phenomena is a generalizable mechanism independent of species, malignancy type, or chemotherapy regime. To test the association of blunted APC activity with MDR cancer behavior, we used matched parental and MDR MCF7 human breast cancer cells, and a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of human triple-negative breast cancer. We show that APC activating mechanisms, such as APC subunit 1 (APC1) phosphorylation and CDC27/CDC20 protein associations, are reduced in MCF7 MDR cells when compared to chemo-sensitive matched cell lines. Consistent with impaired APC function in MDR cells, APC substrate proteins failed to be effectively degraded. Similar to our previous observations in canine MDR lymphoma cells, chemical activation of the APC using Mad2 Inhibitor-1 (M2I-1) in MCF7 MDR cells enhanced APC substrate degradation and resensitized MDR cells in vitro to the cytotoxic effects of the alkylating chemotherapeutic agent, doxorubicin (DOX). Using cell cycle arrest/release experiments, we show that mitosis is delayed in MDR cells with elevated substrate levels. When pretreated with M2I-1, MDR cells progress through mitosis at a faster rate that coincides with reduced levels of APC substrates. In our PDX model, mice growing a clinically MDR human triple-negative breast cancer tumor show significantly reduced tumor growth when treated with M2I-1, with evidence of increased DNA damage and apoptosis. Thus, our results strongly support the hypothesis that APC impairment is a driver of aggressive tumor development and that targeting the APC for activation has the potential for meaningful clinical benefits in treating recurrent cases of MDR malignancy.

    Title: Real-World Experience among Elderly Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients Treated with CDK4/6 Inhibitor-Based Therapy.
    Authors: O'Connor TN, Schultz E, Wang J, O'Connor T, Levine E, Knudsen ES, Witkiewicz AK
    Abstract: The largest portion of breast cancer patients diagnosed after 70 years of age present with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer subtypes. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor treatment, in conjunction with endocrine therapy, has become standard-of-care for metastatic HR+ breast cancer. In total, 320 patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving CDK4/6 inhibitor combined with fulvestrant or an aromatase inhibitor were enrolled in an ongoing observational study or were included in an IRB-approved retrospective study. All patients receiving CDK4/6 inhibitor-based therapy that were >/=70 years of age (n = 111) displayed prolonged progression-free survival (27.6 months) as compared to patients <70 years of age (n = 209, 21.1 months, HR = 1.38, p < 0.05). Specifically, patients receiving a CDK4/6 inhibitor with an aromatase inhibitor who were >/=70 years of age (n = 79) displayed exceptionally prolonged progression-free survival (46.0 months) as compared to patients receiving the same treatment who were <70 years of age (n = 161, 21.8 months, HR = 1.71, p < 0.01). However, patients >/=70 years of age also experienced more frequent adverse responses to CDK4/6 inhibitor-based treatment leading to dose reduction, hold, or discontinuation than the younger cohort (69% and 53%, respectively). Treatment strategies that may decrease toxicity without affecting efficacy (such as dose titration) are worth further exploration.

    Title: Challenges and Opportunities in Breast Cancer Care in Low-Resourced Countries, Jordan as An Example.
    Authors: Abdel-Razeq H, Mansour A
    Abstract: Jordan is a relatively small country with a rapidly growing population and a challenged economy. Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer among women worldwide and also in Jordan. Though the age-standardized rate (ASR) of breast cancer incidence is still lower than that in Western societies, the number of newly diagnosed cases continues to increase, involving younger women, and new cases are usually detected at more advanced stages. Improvements in breast cancer care across the health care continuum, including early detection, prevention, treatment, and survivorship and palliative care, have become very visible, but may not match the magnitude of the problem. More organized, goal-oriented work is urgently needed to downstage the disease and improve awareness of, access to, and participation in early detection programs. The cost of recently introduced anti-cancer therapies poses a great challenge, but the impact of these therapies on treatment outcomes, including overall survival, is becoming very noticeable. Though the concept of a multidisciplinary approach to breast cancer treatment is often used at most health care facilities, its implementation in real practice varies significantly. The availability of breast reconstruction procedures, survivorship programs, germline genetic testing, counselling, and palliative care is improving, but these are not widely practiced. In this manuscript, we review the status of breast cancer in Jordan and highlight some of the existing challenges and opportunities.

    Title: Racial and Ethnic Disparities in European Breast Cancer Clinical Trials.
    Authors: Bania A, Adamou A, Saloustros E
    Abstract: Breast cancer is the most prevalent female cancer worldwide with known correlations between the race and tumor characteristics of the patients and prognosis. International and US-based studies, however, have reported a disproportionate representation of Black and Hispanic patients in clinical trials. This is the first study assessing race and ethnicity reporting trends and inclusion in European breast cancer trials. The PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were systematically searched for trials on breast cancer treatment conducted exclusively in Europe between 2010 and 2022. Of the 97 identified trials, race was reported in 10.31%. Multinational participation, but not the study size or trial phase, was significantly associated with higher race reporting trends. These 10 trials featured a White-predominant population, with 1.08% Asian and 0.88% Black patients included. The acquisition of the race and ethnicity data of patients in European trials is lower compared to the U.S. or worldwide studies and does not permit extensive analysis of minority participation. In a limited analysis, the low rates of minority participation are concerning, based on population-based data on minorities in select European countries. These observations should encourage race reporting practices in European breast cancer trials and adequate minority participation to support the generalizability of the results of the studies and promote healthcare equity.

    Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) presents a therapeutic challenge due to its complex pathology and limited treatment options. Addressing this challenge, our study focuses on the effectiveness of combination therapy, which has recently become a critical strategy in cancer treatment, improving therapeutic outcomes and combating drug resistance and metastasis. We explored a novel combination therapy employing Benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) and Sorafenib (SOR) and their nanoformulation, aiming to enhance therapeutic outcomes against TNBC. Through a series of in vitro assays, we assessed the cytotoxic effects of BITC and SOR, both free and encapsulated. The BITC-SOR-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized using an amphiphilic copolymer, which demonstrated a uniform spherical morphology and favorable size distribution. The encapsulation efficiencies, as well as the sustained release profiles at varied pH levels, were quantified, revealing distinct kinetics that were well-modeled by the Korsmeyer-Peppas equation. The NP delivery system showed a marked dose-dependent cytotoxicity towards TNBC cells, with an IC50 of 7.8 muM for MDA-MB-231 cells, indicating improved efficacy over free drugs, while exhibiting minimal toxicity toward normal breast cells. Furthermore, the NPs significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion in TNBC models, surpassing the effects of free drugs. These findings underscore the potential of BITC-SOR-NPs as a promising therapeutic approach for TNBC, offering targeted delivery while minimizing systemic toxicity.

    Title: Hypomethylation of ATP1A1 Is Associated with Poor Prognosis and Cancer Progression in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.
    Authors: Kim Y, Ko JY, Kong HK, Lee M, Chung W, Lim S, Son D, Oh S, Park JW, Kim DY, Lee M, Han W, Park WY, Yoo KH, Park JH
    Abstract: Dysregulated DNA methylation in cancer is critical in the transcription machinery associated with cancer progression. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype, but no treatment targeting TNBC biomarkers has yet been developed. To identify specific DNA methylation patterns in TNBC, methyl-binding domain protein 2 (MBD) sequencing data were compared in TNBC and the three other major breast cancer subtypes. Integrated analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression identified a gene set showing a correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression. ATPase Na+/K+-transporting subunit alpha 1 (ATP1A1) was found to be specifically hypomethylated in the coding sequence (CDS) region and to show increased expression in TNBC. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database also showed that hypomethylation and high expression of ATP1A1 were strongly associated with poor survival in patients with TNBC. Furthermore, ATP1A1 knockdown significantly reduced the viability and tumor-sphere formation of TNBC cells. These results suggest that the hypomethylation and overexpression of ATP1A1 could be a prognostic marker in TNBC and that the manipulation of ATP1A1 expression could be a therapeutic target in this disease.

    Title: A Metastatic Cancer Expression Generator (MetGen): A Generative Contrastive Learning Framework for Metastatic Cancer Generation.
    Authors: Liu Z, Chiu YC, Chen Y, Huang Y
    Abstract: Despite significant advances in tumor biology and clinical therapeutics, metastasis remains the primary cause of cancer-related deaths. While RNA-seq technology has been used extensively to study metastatic cancer characteristics, challenges persist in acquiring adequate transcriptomic data. To overcome this challenge, we propose MetGen, a generative contrastive learning tool based on a deep learning model. MetGen generates synthetic metastatic cancer expression profiles using primary cancer and normal tissue expression data. Our results demonstrate that MetGen generates comparable samples to actual metastatic cancer samples, and the cancer and tissue classification yields performance rates of 99.8 +/- 0.2% and 95.0 +/- 2.3%, respectively. A benchmark analysis suggests that the proposed model outperforms traditional generative models such as the variational autoencoder. In metastatic subtype classification, our generated samples show 97.6% predicting power compared to true metastatic samples. Additionally, we demonstrate MetGen's interpretability using metastatic prostate cancer and metastatic breast cancer. MetGen has learned highly relevant signatures in cancer, tissue, and tumor microenvironments, such as immune responses and the metastasis process, which can potentially foster a more comprehensive understanding of metastatic cancer biology. The development of MetGen represents a significant step toward the study of metastatic cancer biology by providing a generative model that identifies candidate therapeutic targets for the treatment of metastatic cancer.

    Title: Liver X Receptor Ligand GAC0001E5 Downregulates Antioxidant Capacity and ERBB2/HER2 Expression in HER2-Positive Breast Cancer Cells.
    Authors: Premaratne A, Basu S, Bagchi A, Zhou T, Feng Q, Lin CY
    Abstract: The HER2-positive subtype accounts for approximately one-fifth of all breast cancers. Insensitivity and development of acquired resistance to targeted therapies in some patients contribute to their poor prognosis. HER2 overexpression is associated with metabolic reprogramming, facilitating cancer cell growth and survival. Novel liver X receptor (LXR) ligand GAC0001E5 (1E5) has been shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation by disrupting glutaminolysis and inducing oxidative stress. In this study, HER2-positive breast cancer cells were treated with 1E5 to determine their potential inhibitory effects and mechanisms of action in HER2-positive breast cancers. Similar to previous observations in other cancer types, 1E5 treatments inhibited LXR activity, expression, and cancer cell proliferation. Expression of fatty acid synthesis genes, including fatty acid synthase (FASN), was downregulated following 1E5 treatment, and results from co-treatment experiments with an FASN inhibitor suggest that the same pathway is targeted by 1E5. Treatments with 1E5 disrupted glutaminolysis and resulted in increased oxidative stress. Strikingly, HER2 transcript and protein levels were both significantly downregulated by 1E5. Taken together, these findings indicate the therapeutic potential of targeting HER2 overexpression and associated metabolic reprogramming via the modulation of LXR in HER2-positive breast cancers.

    Title: The Safety and Efficacy of the Combination of Sacituzumab Govitecan and Palliative Radiotherapy-A Retrospective Multi-Center Cohort Study.
    Authors: Krug D, Tio J, Abaci A, Beurer B, Brugge S, Elsayad K, Meixner E, Park-Simon TW, Smetanay K, Winkelmann F, Wittig A, Wockel A
    Abstract: Sacituzumab govitecan (SG) is a new treatment option for patients with metastatic triple-negative and hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. This antibody-drug conjugate is currently approved as monotherapy. Palliative radiotherapy is frequently used to treat symptomatic metastases locally. Concurrent use of SG and irradiation was excluded in clinical trials of SG, and there are currently limited published data. We report here a systematic review, as well as a retrospective multi-center study of 17 patients with triple-negative breast cancer who received concurrent SG and radiotherapy. In these patients, concurrent use was found to be efficient, safe and well tolerated. There were no apparent differences in moderate or severe acute toxicity according to the timing of SG administration.

    Title: Axillary Surgery for Breast Cancer in 2024.
    Authors: Heidinger M, Weber WP
    Abstract: Axillary surgery for patients with breast cancer (BC) in 2024 is becoming increasingly specific, moving away from the previous 'one size fits all' radical approach. The goal is to spare morbidity whilst maintaining oncologic safety. In the upfront surgery setting, a first landmark randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the omission of any surgical axillary staging in patients with unremarkable clinical examination and axillary ultrasound showed non-inferiority to sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (SLNB). The study population consisted of 87.8% postmenopausal patients with estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative BC. Patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer and up to two positive SLNs can safely be spared axillary dissection (ALND) even in the context of mastectomy or extranodal extension. In patients enrolled in the TAXIS trial, adjuvant systemic treatment was shown to be similar with or without ALND despite the loss of staging information. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), targeted lymph node removal with or without SLNB showed a lower false-negative rate to determine nodal pathological complete response (pCR) compared to SLNB alone. However, oncologic outcomes do not appear to differ in patients with nodal pCR determined by either one of the two concepts, according to a recently published global, retrospective, real-world study. Real-world studies generally have a lower level of evidence than RCTs, but they are feasible quickly and with a large sample size. Another global real-world study provides evidence that even patients with residual isolated tumor cells can be safely spared from ALND. In general, few indications for ALND remain. Three randomized controlled trials are ongoing for patients with clinically node-positive BC in the upfront surgery setting and residual disease after NACT. Pending the results of these trials, ALND remains indicated in these patients.

    Title: Multiplex Digital Spatial Profiling in Breast Cancer Research: State-of-the-Art Technologies and Applications across the Translational Science Spectrum.
    Authors: Rossi M, Radisky DC
    Abstract: While RNA sequencing and multi-omic approaches have significantly advanced cancer diagnosis and treatment, their limitation in preserving critical spatial information has been a notable drawback. This spatial context is essential for understanding cellular interactions and tissue dynamics. Multiplex digital spatial profiling (MDSP) technologies overcome this limitation by enabling the simultaneous analysis of transcriptome and proteome data within the intact spatial architecture of tissues. In breast cancer research, MDSP has emerged as a promising tool, revealing complex biological questions related to disease evolution, identifying biomarkers, and discovering drug targets. This review highlights the potential of MDSP to revolutionize clinical applications, ranging from risk assessment and diagnostics to prognostics, patient monitoring, and the customization of treatment strategies, including clinical trial guidance. We discuss the major MDSP techniques, their applications in breast cancer research, and their integration in clinical practice, addressing both their potential and current limitations. Emphasizing the strategic use of MDSP in risk stratification for women with benign breast disease, we also highlight its transformative potential in reshaping the landscape of breast cancer research and treatment.

    Title: Implementation of a clinical breast exam and referral program in a rural district of Pakistan.
    Authors: Martins RS, Arif A, Yameen S, Noordin S, Masroor T, Muhammad S, Channa M, Soofi SB, Sattar AK
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: The role of clinical breast examination (CBE) for early detection of breast cancer is extremely important in lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) where access to breast imaging is limited. Our study aimed to describe the outcomes of a community outreach breast education, home CBE and referral program for early recognition of breast abnormalities and improvement of breast cancer awareness in a rural district of Pakistan. METHODS: Eight health care workers (HCW) and a gynecologist were educated on basic breast cancer knowledge and trained to create breast cancer awareness and conduct CBE in the community. They were then deployed in the Dadu district of Pakistan where they carried out home visits to perform CBE in the community. Breast cancer awareness was assessed in the community using a standardized questionnaire and standard educational intervention was performed. Clinically detectable breast lesions were identified during home CBE and women were referred to the study gynecologist to confirm the presence of clinical abnormalities. Those confirmed to have clinical abnormalities were referred for imaging. Follow-up home visits were carried out to assess reasons for non-compliance in patients who did not follow-through with the gynecologist appointment or prescribed imaging and re-enforce the need for follow-up. RESULTS: Basic breast cancer knowledge of HCWs and study gynecologist improved post-intervention. HCWs conducted home CBE in 8757 women. Of these, 149 were warranted a CBE by a physician (to avoid missing an abnormality), while 20 were found to have a definitive lump by HCWs, all were referred to the study gynecologist (CBE checkpoint). Only 50% (10/20) of those with a suspected lump complied with the referral to the gynecologist, where 90% concordance was found between their CBEs. Follow-up home visits were conducted in 119/169 non-compliant patients. Major reasons for non-compliance were a lack of understanding of the risks and financial constraints. A significant improvement was observed in the community's breast cancer knowledge at the follow-up visits using the standardized post-test. CONCLUSIONS: Basic and focused education of HCWs can increase their knowledge and dispel myths. Hand-on structured training can enable HCWs to perform CBE. Community awareness is essential for patient compliance and for early-detection, diagnosis, and treatment.

    Title: Autologous patient-derived exhausted nano T-cells exploit tumor immune evasion to engage an effective cancer therapy.
    Authors: Blaya-Canovas JL, Grinan-Lison C, Blancas I, Marchal JA, Ramirez-Tortosa C, Lopez-Tejada A, Benabdellah K, Cortijo-Gutierrez M, Cano-Cortes MV, Gravan P, Navarro-Marchal SA, Gomez-Morales J, Delgado-Almenta V, Calahorra J, Agudo-Lera M, Sagarzazu A, Rodriguez-Gonzalez CJ, Gallart-Aragon T, Eich C, Sanchez-Martin RM, Granados-Principal S
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Active targeting by surface-modified nanoplatforms enables a more precise and elevated accumulation of nanoparticles within the tumor, thereby enhancing drug delivery and efficacy for a successful cancer treatment. However, surface functionalization involves complex procedures that increase costs and timelines, presenting challenges for clinical implementation. Biomimetic nanoparticles (BNPs) have emerged as unique drug delivery platforms that overcome the limitations of actively targeted nanoparticles. Nevertheless, BNPs coated with unmodified cells show reduced functionalities such as specific tumor targeting, decreasing the therapeutic efficacy. Those challenges can be overcome by engineering non-patient-derived cells for BNP coating, but these are complex and cost-effective approaches that hinder their wider clinical application. Here we present an immune-driven strategy to improve nanotherapeutic delivery to tumors. Our unique perspective harnesses T-cell exhaustion and tumor immune evasion to develop a groundbreaking new class of BNPs crafted from exhausted T-cells (NExT) of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients by specific culture methods without sophisticated engineering. METHODS: NExT were generated by coating PLGA (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)) nanoparticles with TNBC-derived T-cells exhausted in vitro by acute activation. Physicochemical characterization of NExT was made by dynamic light scattering, electrophoretic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy, and preservation and orientation of immune checkpoint receptors by flow cytometry. The efficacy of chemotherapy-loaded NExT was assessed in TNBC cell lines in vitro. In vivo toxicity was made in CD1 mice. Biodistribution and therapeutic activity of NExT were determined in cell-line- and autologous patient-derived xenografts in immunodeficient mice. RESULTS: We report a cost-effective approach with a good performance that provides NExT naturally endowed with immune checkpoint receptors (PD1, LAG3, TIM3), augmenting specific tumor targeting by engaging cognate ligands, enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapy, and disrupting the PD1/PDL1 axis in an immunotherapy-like way. Autologous patient-derived NExT revealed exceptional intratumor accumulation, heightened chemotherapeutic index and efficiency, and targeted the tumor stroma in a PDL1(+) patient-derived xenograft model of triple-negative breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: These advantages underline the potential of autologous patient-derived NExT to revolutionize tailored adoptive cancer nanotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy, which endorses their widespread clinical application of autologous patient-derived NExT.

    Title: Multiomics-based molecular subtyping based on the commensal microbiome predicts molecular characteristics and the therapeutic response in breast cancer.
    Authors: Qin W, Li J, Gao N, Kong X, Guo L, Chen Y, Huang L, Chen X, Qi F
    Abstract: The gut microbiota has been demonstrated to be correlated with the clinical phenotypes of diseases, including cancers. However, there are few studies on clinical subtyping based on the gut microbiota, especially in breast cancer (BC) patients. Here, using machine learning methods, we analysed the gut microbiota of BC, colorectal cancer (CRC), and gastric cancer (GC) patients to identify their shared metabolic pathways and the importance of these pathways in cancer development. Based on the gut microbiota-related metabolic pathways, human gene expression profile and patient prognosis, we established a novel BC subtyping system and identified a subtype called "challenging BC". Tumours with this subtype have more genetic mutations and a more complex immune environment than those of other subtypes. A score index was proposed for in-depth analysis and showed a significant negative correlation with patient prognosis. Notably, activation of the TPK1-FOXP3-mediated Hedgehog signalling pathway and TPK1-ITGAE-mediated mTOR signalling pathway was linked to poor prognosis in "challenging BC" patients with high scores, as validated in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. Furthermore, our subtyping system and score index are effective predictors of the response to current neoadjuvant therapy regimens, with the score index significantly negatively correlated with both treatment efficacy and the number of immune cells. Therefore, our findings provide valuable insights into predicting molecular characteristics and treatment responses in "challenging BC" patients.

    Title: General practitioners' management of mastitis in breastfeeding women: a mixed method study in Australia.
    Authors: Amir LH, Crawford SB, Cullinane M, Grzeskowiak LE
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Mastitis is a common reason new mothers visit their general practitioner (GP). In Australia, the Therapeutic Guidelines: Antibiotic provides practical advice to GPs managing a range of infections, including mastitis. It is not known if Australian GPs prescribe antibiotics and order investigations as recommended for the management of mastitis. METHODS: A convergent mixed methods design integrated quantitative analysis of a general practice dataset with analysis of interviews with GPs. Using the large-scale primary care dataset, MedicineInsight, (2021-2022), antibiotics prescribed and investigations ordered for mastitis encounters were extracted. Mastitis encounters were identified by searching 'Encounter reason', 'Test reason' and 'Prescription reason' free text field for the term 'mastitis'; 'granulomatous mastitis' was excluded. Clinical encounters for mastitis occurring within 14 days of a previous mastitis encounter were defined as belonging to the same treatment episode. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 Australian GPs using Zoom or telephone in 2021-2022, and analysed thematically. The Pillar Integration Process was used to develop a joint display table; qualitative codes and themes were matched with the quantitative items to illustrate similarities/contrasts in findings. RESULTS: During an encounter for mastitis, 3122 (91.7%) women received a prescription for an oral antibiotic; most commonly di/flucloxacillin ([59.4%]) or cefalexin (937 [27.5%]). Investigations recorded ultrasound in 303 (8.9%), blood tests (full blood examination [FBE]: 170 [5.0%]; C-reactive protein [CRP]: 71 [2.1%]; erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]: 34 [1.0%]) and breast milk or nipple swab cultures in approximately 1% of encounters. Analysis using pillar integration showed consistency between quantitative and qualitative data regarding mastitis management. The following themes were identified: - GPs support continued breastfeeding. - Antibiotics are central to GPs' management. - Antibiotics are mostly prescribed according to Therapeutic Guidelines. - Analgesia is a gap in the Therapeutic Guidelines. - Low use of breast milk culture. CONCLUSIONS: Prescribing antibiotics for mastitis remains central to Australian GPs' management of mastitis. Interview data clarified that GPs were aware that antibiotics might not be needed in all cases of mastitis and that delayed prescribing was not uncommon. Overall, GPs followed principles of antibiotic stewardship, however there is a need to train GPs about when to consider ordering investigations.

    Title: Clinical features of patients with carcinoma soft tissue metastases as surgical indications: a retrospective cohort study.
    Authors: Morinaga S, Yamamoto N, Hayashi K, Takeuchi A, Miwa S, Igarashi K, Taniguchi Y, Asano Y, Nojima T, Tsuchiya H
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Soft-tissue metastasis of carcinoma is rare. In the present study, we investigated the surgical indications and clinical features of patients with soft tissue metastases of carcinoma. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled 26 patients with soft tissue carcinoma metastasis referred to our department for treatment. Sex, age, location, size, depth, pain due to the tumor, primary origin, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level, MRI examinations, diagnosis by a previous physician, carcinoma markers from blood, history of carcinoma, other metastases, performance status (PS), and surgical procedures were documented. Associations between variables and surgery were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The primary cancer origin was found to be the lung (n = 10), kidney (n = 7), esophagus (n = 2), stomach (n = 1), breast (n = 1), liver (n = 1), ureter (n = 1), anus (n = 1), and unknown (n = 2). The mean CRP level of all patients was 2.3 mg/dL. Seven tumors (26.9%) were originally suspected to be soft tissue metastases of carcinoma, while 19 tumors (73.1%) were considered soft tissue sarcomas or inflammatory lesions by the previous treating physician. Twenty patients (76.9%) had other metastases. The PS of the 12 patients (46.2%) was zero. Eleven patients (42.3%) underwent surgery for soft tissue metastases. Diagnosis of soft tissue metastasis by a previous physician and good PS (p < 0.05) were significantly associated with surgery. CONCLUSION: Overall, the present results show that surgical indications for soft tissue metastasis of carcinoma include diagnosis by the referring physician or good PS of the patients.

    Title: Effect of immediate initiation of invasive ventilation on mortality in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure: a target trial emulation.
    Authors: Mellado-Artigas R, Borrat X, Ferreyro BL, Yarnell C, Hao S, Wanis KN, Barbeta E, Torres A, Ferrando C, Brochard L
    Abstract: PURPOSE: Invasive ventilation is a fundamental treatment in intensive care but its precise timing is difficult to determine. This study aims at assessing the effect of initiating invasive ventilation versus waiting, in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure without immediate reason for intubation on one-year mortality. METHODS: Emulation of a target trial to estimate the benefit of immediately initiating invasive ventilation in hypoxemic respiratory failure, versus waiting, among patients within the first 48-h of hypoxemia. The eligible population included non-intubated patients with SpO(2)/FiO(2) </= 200 and SpO(2) </= 97%. The target trial was emulated using a single-center database (MIMIC-IV) which contains granular information about clinical status. The hourly probability to receive mechanical ventilation was continuously estimated. The hazard ratios for the primary outcome, one-year mortality, and the secondary outcome, 30-day mortality, were estimated using weighted Cox models with stabilized inverse probability weights used to adjust for measured confounding. RESULTS: 2996 Patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria of whom 792 were intubated within 48 h. Among the non-invasive support devices, the use of oxygen through facemask was the most common (75%). Compared to patients with the same probability of intubation but who were not intubated, intubation decreased the hazard of dying for the first year after ICU admission HR 0.81 (95% CI 0.68-0.96, p = 0.018). Intubation was associated with a 30-day mortality HR of 0.80 (95% CI 0.64-0.99, p = 0.046). CONCLUSION: The initiation of mechanical ventilation in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure reduced the hazard of dying in this emulation of a target trial.

    Title: Breast cancer diagnosis using support vector machine optimized by improved quantum inspired grey wolf optimization.
    Authors: Bilal A, Imran A, Baig TI, Liu X, Abouel Nasr E, Long H
    Abstract: A prompt diagnosis of breast cancer in its earliest phases is necessary for effective treatment. While Computer-Aided Diagnosis systems play a crucial role in automated mammography image processing, interpretation, grading, and early detection of breast cancer, existing approaches face limitations in achieving optimal accuracy. This study addresses these limitations by hybridizing the improved quantum-inspired binary Grey Wolf Optimizer with the Support Vector Machines Radial Basis Function Kernel. This hybrid approach aims to enhance the accuracy of breast cancer classification by determining the optimal Support Vector Machine parameters. The motivation for this hybridization lies in the need for improved classification performance compared to existing optimizers such as Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithm. Evaluate the efficacy of the proposed IQI-BGWO-SVM approach on the MIAS dataset, considering various metric parameters, including accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Furthermore, the application of IQI-BGWO-SVM for feature selection will be explored, and the results will be compared. Experimental findings demonstrate that the suggested IQI-BGWO-SVM technique outperforms state-of-the-art classification methods on the MIAS dataset, with a resulting mean accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 99.25%, 98.96%, and 100%, respectively, using a tenfold cross-validation datasets partition.

    Title: Iterative Development of an Interactive Website to Support Shared Decision-Making in Metastatic Breast Cancer.
    Authors: Conley CC, Cumbo S, Chavez Ochoa J, Boles A, Rodriguez JD, Schwab N, Farrell D, Abduljawad S, Isaacs C, O'Neill SC
    Abstract: Recent treatment advances have resulted in significantly increased survival times following metastatic breast cancer (MBC) diagnosis. Novel treatment approaches-and their related side effects-have changed the landscape of MBC treatment decision-making. We developed a prototype of an online educational tool to prepare patients with MBC for shared decision-making with their oncologists. We describe the five phases of tool development: (1) in-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews and (2) feedback on storyboards of initial content with patients with MBC and oncology providers. This was followed by three phases of iterative feedback with patients in which they responded to (3) initial, non-navigable website content and (4) a beta version of the full website. In the final phase (5), patients newly diagnosed with MBC (N = 6) used the website prototype for 1 week and completed surveys assessing acceptability, feasibility, treatment knowledge, preparation for decision-making, and self-efficacy for decision-making. Participants in Phase 1 characterized a cyclical process of MBC treatment decision-making and identified key information needs. Website content and structure was iteratively developed in Phases 2-4. Most participants in Phase 5 (n = 4) accessed the website 2-5 times. All participants who accessed the website at least once (n = 5) felt they learned new information from the website prototype and would recommend it to others newly-diagnosed with MBC. After using the website prototype, participants reported high preparation and self-efficacy for decision-making. This multiphase, iterative process resulted in a prototype intervention designed to support decision-making for MBC patients.

    Title: Radiolabelling and preclinical characterisation of [(89)Zr]Zr-Df-ATG-101 bispecific to PD-L1/4-1BB.
    Authors: Cao Z, Wichmann CW, Burvenich IJG, Osellame LD, Guo N, Rigopoulos A, O'Keefe GJ, Scott FE, Lorensuhewa N, Lynch KP, Scott AM
    Abstract: PURPOSE: ATG-101, a bispecific antibody that simultaneously targets the immune checkpoint PD-L1 and the costimulatory receptor 4-1BB, activates exhausted T cells upon PD-L1 crosslinking. Previous studies demonstrated promising anti-tumour efficacy of ATG-101 in preclinical models. Here, we labelled ATG-101 with (89)Zr to confirm its tumour targeting effect and tissue biodistribution in a preclinical model. We also evaluated the use of immuno-PET to study tumour uptake of ATG-101 in vivo. METHODS: ATG-101, anti-PD-L1, and an isotype control were conjugated with p-SCN-Deferoxamine (Df). The Df-conjugated antibodies were radiolabelled with (89)Zr, and their radiochemical purity, immunoreactivity, and serum stability were assessed. We conducted PET/MRI and biodistribution studies on [(89)Zr]Zr-Df-ATG-101 in BALB/c nude mice bearing PD-L1-expressing MDA-MB-231 breast cancer xenografts for up to 10 days after intravenous administration of [(89)Zr]Zr-labelled antibodies. The specificity of [(89)Zr]Zr-Df-ATG-101 was evaluated through a competition study with unlabelled ATG-101 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies. RESULTS: The Df-conjugation and [(89)Zr]Zr -radiolabelling did not affect the target binding of ATG-101. Biodistribution and imaging studies demonstrated biological similarity of [(89)Zr]Zr-Df-ATG-101 and [(89)Zr]Zr-Df-anti-PD-L1. Tumour uptake of [(89)Zr]Zr-Df-ATG-101 was clearly visualised using small-animal PET imaging up to 7 days post-injection. Competition studies confirmed the specificity of PD-L1 targeting in vivo. CONCLUSION: [(89)Zr]Zr-Df-ATG-101 in vivo distribution is dependent on PD-L1 expression in the MDA-MB-231 xenograft model. Immuno-PET with [(89)Zr]Zr-Df-ATG-101 provides real-time information about ATG-101 distribution and tumour uptake in vivo. Our data support the use of [(89)Zr]Zr-Df-ATG-101 to assess tumour and tissue uptake of ATG-101.

    Title: Lessons learned from COVID-19: improving breast cancer care post-pandemic from the patient perspective.
    Authors: Myers C, Bennett K, Cahir C
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Since the onset of the pandemic, breast cancer (BC) services have been disrupted in most countries. The purpose of this qualitative study is to explore the unmet needs, patient-priorities, and recommendations for improving BC healthcare post-pandemic for women with BC and to understand how they may vary based on social determinants of health (SDH), in particular socio-economic status (SES). METHODS: Thirty-seven women, who were purposively sampled based on SDH and previously interviewed about the impact of COVID-19 on BC, were invited to take part in follow-up semi-structured qualitative interviews in early 2023. The interviews explored their perspectives of BC care since the easing of COVID-19 government restrictions, including unmet needs, patient-priorities, and recommendations specific to BC care. Thematic analysis was conducted to synthesize each topic narratively with corresponding sub-themes. Additionally, variation by SDH was analyzed within each sub-theme. RESULTS: Twenty-eight women (mean age = 61.7 years, standard deviation (SD) = 12.3) participated in interviews (response rate = 76%). Thirty-nine percent (n = 11) of women were categorized as high-SES, while 61% (n = 17) of women were categorized as low-SES. Women expressed unmet needs in their BC care including routine care and mental and physical well-being care, as well as a lack of financial support to access BC care. Patient priorities included the following: developing cohesion between different aspects of BC care; communication with and between healthcare professionals; and patient empowerment within BC care. Recommendations moving forward post-pandemic included improving the transition from active to post-treatment, enhancing support resources, and implementing telemedicine where appropriate. Overall, women of low-SES experienced more severe unmet needs, which in turn resulted in varied patient priorities and recommendations. CONCLUSION: As health systems are recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, the emphasis should be on restoring access to BC care and improving the quality of BC care, with a particular consideration given to those women from low-SES, to reduce health inequalities post-pandemic.

    Title: Research progress on morphology and mechanism of programmed cell death.
    Authors: Chen Y, Li X, Yang M, Liu SB
    Abstract: Programmed cell death (PCD) is a basic process of life that is closely related to the growth, development, aging and disease of organisms and is one of the hotspots of life science research today. PCD is a kind of genetic control, autonomous and orderly important cell death that involves the activation, expression, and regulation of a series of genes. In recent years, with the deepening of research in this field, new mechanisms of multiple PCD pathways have been revealed. This article reviews and summarizes the multiple PCD pathways that have been discovered, analyses and compares the morphological characteristics and biomarkers of different types of PCD, and briefly discusses the role of various types of PCD in the diagnosis and treatment of different diseases, especially malignant tumors.

    Title: Female Sexual Function Index Adaptation for Breast Cancer Patients (FSFI-BC): Brazilian Portuguese Translation and Cultural Adaptation.
    Authors: Goncalves ACN, Amorim RB, Domingues BS, Sousa JVA, Veiga DF
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: The assessment of female sexual function after diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer is relevant, as cancer can negatively affect sexuality and, therefore, quality of life. Instruments assessing female sexuality can be useful in clinical practice. However, there are few validated instruments available for this purpose. This study aimed to translate the Female Sexual Function Index Adaptation for Breast Cancer Patients (FSFI-BC) into Brazilian Portuguese and culturally adapt it for use in Brazil. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Translation and cross-cultural adaptation followed the linguistic validation process, according to international guidelines. The instrument was translated and back-translated by independent translators. Sixty women aged 25 to 70 years who had been diagnosed and surgically treated for breast cancer at least 6 months previously participated in the cultural adaptation process. Participants were stratified into sexually active or inactive. Internal consistency was analyzed using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. RESULTS: Mean participant age was 52.5 years. For sexually active women, reliability analysis (Cronbach's alpha) showed excellent internal consistency between the items of the subscales 'Desire/Arousal' (alpha = 0.912) and 'Orgasm' (alpha = 0.904), and good internal consistency for 'Lubrication' (alpha = 0.814) and 'Pain' (alpha = 0.839). For sexually inactive women, excellent internal consistency was observed between the items of the subscale 'Reason for Inactivity - difficulty lubricating' (alpha = 0.930), and good internal consistency for the other subscales. The instrument had face and content validity. CONCLUSIONS: FSFI-BC was translated and culturally adapted to the context of the Brazilian population.

    Title: Effectiveness and Safety of Pyrotinib-Based Therapy in the Treatment of HER2-Positive Breast Cancer Patients with Brain Metastases: A Multicenter Real-World Study.
    Authors: Huang J, Sun S, Tan Q, Zheng F, Zhou D, Man X, Hu Y, Li W, Song L, Zhang B, Xu L, Wang X, Xie X, Li H
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Approximately 30% to 50% of patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive metastatic breast cancer develop brain metastasis (BMs). Pyrotinib has shown promising efficacy in these patients. However, real-world evidence supporting its use is scarce. Therefore, we evaluate the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib-based regimens in the real world. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled patients with BMs from various healthcare facilities in China's Shandong region and used an updated breast-graded prognostic assessment (breast-GPA) to predict survival outcomes. RESULTS: Efficacy and toxicity were assessed in 101 patients. Overall, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 11.0 months (95% CI, 7.6-14.4 months). PFS was shorter in patients with a breast-GPA of 0 to 2.0 (P< .001). Previous treatment with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab (P = .039) and varying numbers of BMs (P = .028) had a significant positive correlation with PFS. Additionally, radiotherapy (P = .033) for BMs, especially pyrotinib concurrent with radiotherapy (P = .013), significantly prolonged the PFS. In patients with a breast-GPA of 0 to 2.0, a significant difference in PFS was observed depending on whether the brain was the first metastatic site (P< .001). Furthermore, a breast-GPA (0-2.0 vs. 2.5-4.0), and radiotherapy for BMs were found to be independent predictors of PFS. Overall, the objective response rate was 42.6%, while the disease control rate was 88.1%. Diarrhea emerged as the most common adverse event. CONCLUSION: Pyrotinib-based therapy is effective and tolerable in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive metastatic breast cancer with BMs. Patients who underwent radiotherapy for BMs, particularly those who received pyrotinib concurrently with radiotherapy, exhibited a more favorable prognosis.

    Title: A Phase 1 dose escalation and expansion trial of the next-generation oral SERD camizestrant in women with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer: SERENA-1 monotherapy results.
    Authors: Hamilton E, Oliveira M, Turner N, Garcia-Corbacho J, Hernando C, Ciruelos EM, Kabos P, Borrego MR, Armstrong A, Patel MR, Vaklavas C, Twelves C, Boni V, Incorvati J, Brier T, Gibbons L, Klinowska T, Lindemann JPO, Morrow CJ, Sykes A, Baird R
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: SERENA-1 (NCT03616587) is a Phase 1, multi-part, open-label study of camizestrant in pre- and post-menopausal women with ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer. Parts A and B aim to determine the safety and tolerability of camizestrant monotherapy and define doses for clinical evaluation. Patients and Methods Women aged 18 years or older with metastatic or recurrent ER+, HER2- breast cancer, refractory (or intolerant) to therapy were assigned 25 mg up to 450 mg once daily (QD; escalation) or 75, 150, or 300 mg QD (expansion). Safety and tolerability, anti-tumor efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and impact on ESR1m circulating tumor (ct)DNA levels were assessed. RESULTS: By 9 March 2021, 108 patients received camizestrant monotherapy at 25-450 mg doses. Of these, 93 (86.1%) experienced treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), 82.4% of which were grade 1 or 2. The most common TRAEs were visual effects (56%), (sinus) bradycardia (44%), fatigue (26%), and nausea (15%). There were no TRAEs grade 3 or higher, or treatment-related serious adverse events (TRSAEs) at doses </=150 mg. Median t(max) was achieved  approximately 2-4 hours post-dose at all doses investigated, with an estimated half-life of 20-23 hours. Efficacy was observed at all doses investigated, including in patients with prior CDK4/6 inhibitor and/or fulvestrant treatment, with and without baseline ESR1 mutations, and with visceral disease, including liver metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Camizestrant is a next-generation oral SERD and pure ER antagonist with a tolerable safety profile. The pharmacokinetics profile supports once-daily dosing, with evidence of pharmacodynamic and clinical efficacy in heavily pre-treated patients, regardless of ESR1m. This study established 75, 150 and 300 mg QD doses for Phase 2 testing (SERENA-2, NCT04214288 and SERENA-3, NCT04588298).

    Title: Abemaciclib plus a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor as initial therapy for HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer: Final overall survival results of MONARCH 3.
    Authors: Goetz MP, Toi M, Huober J, Sohn J, Tredan O, Park IH, Campone M, Chen SC, Manso LM, Paluch-Shimon S, Freedman OC, O'Shaughnessy J, Pivot X, Tolaney SM, Hurvitz S, Llombart-Cussac A, Andre V, Saha A, van Hal G, Shahir A, Iwata H, Johnston SRD
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: In MONARCH 2, the addition of abemaciclib to fulvestrant significantly improved both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer (ABC) with disease progression on prior endocrine therapy (ET). In MONARCH 3, the addition of abemaciclib to a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) as initial therapy for HR+, HER2- ABC significantly improved PFS. Here, we present the prespecified final OS results for MONARCH 3. PATIENTS AND METHODS: MONARCH 3 is a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study of abemaciclib plus NSAI (anastrozole or letrozole) versus placebo plus NSAI in postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- ABC without prior systemic therapy in the advanced setting. The primary objective was investigator-assessed PFS; OS was a gated secondary endpoint, and chemotherapy-free survival (CFS) was an exploratory endpoint. RESULTS: A total of 493 women were randomized 2:1 to receive abemaciclib plus NSAI (n = 328) or placebo plus NSAI (n = 165). After a median follow-up of 8.1 years, there were 198 OS events (60.4%) in the abemaciclib arm and 116 (70.3%) in the placebo arm (hazard ratio, 0.804; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.637-1.015; P = 0.0664, non-significant). Median OS was 66.8 versus 53.7 months for abemaciclib versus placebo. In the subgroup with visceral disease (sVD), there were 113 OS events (65.3%) in the abemaciclib arm and 65 (72.2%) in the placebo arm (hazard ratio, 0.758; 95% CI, 0.558-1.030; P = 0.0757, non-significant). Median OS was 63.7 months versus 48.8 months for abemaciclib versus placebo. The previously demonstrated PFS benefit was sustained, and CFS numerically improved with the addition of abemaciclib. No new safety signals were observed. CONCLUSION: Abemaciclib combined with an NSAI resulted in clinically meaningful improvement in median OS (ITT: 13.1 months; sVD: 14.9 months) in patients with HR+ HER2- ABC; however, statistical significance was not reached.

    Title: MICAL-L2, as an estrogen-responsive gene, is involved in ER-positive breast cancer cell progression and tamoxifen sensitivity via the AKT/mTOR pathway.
    Authors: Wen P, Li J, Wen Z, Guo X, Ma G, Hu S, Xu J, Zhao H, Li R, Liu Y, Wang Y, Gao J
    Abstract: Endocrine treatment, particularly tamoxifen, has shown significant improvement in the prognosis of patients with estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive) breast cancer. However, the clinical utility of this treatment is often hindered by the development of endocrine resistance. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving ER-positive breast cancer carcinogenesis and endocrine resistance is crucial to overcome this clinical challenge. In this study, we investigated the expression of MICAL-L2 in ER-positive breast cancer and its impact on patient prognosis. We observed a significant upregulation of MICAL-L2 expression in ER-positive breast cancer, which correlated with a poorer prognosis in these patients. Furthermore, we found that estrogen-ERbeta signaling promoted the expression of MICAL-L2. Functionally, our study demonstrated that MICAL-L2 not only played an oncogenic role in ER-positive breast cancer tumorigenesis but also influenced the sensitivity of ER-positive breast cancer cells to tamoxifen. Mechanistically, as an estrogen-responsive gene, MICAL-L2 facilitated the activation of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in ER-positive breast cancer cells. Collectively, our findings suggest that MICAL-L2 could serve as a potential prognostic marker for ER-positive breast cancer and represent a promising molecular target for improving endocrine treatment and developing therapeutic approaches for this subtype of breast cancer.

    Title: Immunotherapies for locally aggressive cancers.
    Authors: Adams SC, Nambiar AK, Bressler EM, Raut CP, Colson YL, Wong WW, Grinstaff MW
    Abstract: Improving surgical resection outcomes for locally aggressive tumors is key to inducing durable locoregional disease control and preventing progression to metastatic disease. Macroscopically complete resection of the tumor is the standard of care for many cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, sarcoma, and mesothelioma. Advancements in cancer diagnostics are increasing the number of surgically eligible cases through early detection. Thus, a unique opportunity arises to improve patient outcomes with decreased recurrence rates via intraoperative delivery treatments using local drug delivery strategies after the tumor has been resected. Of the current systemic treatments (e.g., chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and immunotherapies), immunotherapies are the latest approach to offer significant benefits. Intraoperative strategies benefit from direct access to the tumor microenvironment which improves drug uptake to the tumor and simultaneously minimizes the risk of drug entering healthy tissues thereby resulting in fewer or less toxic adverse events. We review the current state of immunotherapy development and discuss the opportunities that intraoperative treatment provides. We conclude by summarizing progress in current research, identifying areas for exploration, and discussing future prospects in sustained remission.

    Title: A radiation therapy contouring atlas for delineation of the level I-II axilla in the prone position: a single institution experience.
    Authors: Purswani JM, Goldberg E, Cahlon O, Schnabel F, Axelrod D, Guth A, Perez CA, Shaikh F, Tam M, Formenti S, Reig B, Gerber NK
    Abstract: PURPOSE: With transition from supine to prone, tenting of the pectoralis major occurs displacing the muscle from the chest wall and shifting the level I-II axillary spaces. For patients whom we aim to treat the level I-II axilla using the prone technique, accurate delineation of these nodal regions is necessary. While different consensus guidelines exist for delineation of nodal anatomy supine, to our knowledge there are no contouring guidelines in the prone position that account for this change in nodal anatomy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The level I-II nodal contours from the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) breast cancer supine atlas were adapted for prone position by two radiation oncologists and a breast radiologist based on anatomic changes observed from supine to prone positioning on preoperative diagnostic imaging. Forty-three patients from a single institution treated with prone high tangents from 2012 to 2018 were identified as representative cases to delineate the revised level I-II axilla on non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scans obtained during radiation simulation. The revised nodal contours were reviewed by an expanded expert multidisciplinary panel including breast radiologists, radiation oncologists, and surgical oncologists for consistency and reproducibility. RESULTS: Consensus was achieved among the panel in order to create modifications from the RTOG breast atlas for CT-based contouring of the level I-II axilla prone using bone, muscle and skin as landmarks. This atlas provides representative examples and accompanying descriptions for the changes described to the caudal and anterior border of level II, and the anterior, posterior, medial and lateral border of level I. A step-by-step guide is provided for properly identifying the revised anterior border of the level I axilla. CONCLUSIONS: The adaptations to the RTOG breast cancer atlas for prone positioning will enable radiation oncologists to more accurately target the level I-II axilla when the axilla is a target in addition to the breast.

    Title: Unlocking the adaptive advantage: correlation and machine learning classification to identify optimal online adaptive stereotactic partial breast candidates.
    Authors: Pogue JA, Harms JM, Cardenas CE, Ray X, Viscariello N, Popple RA, Stanley D, Boggs DH
    Abstract: Online adaptive radiotherapy (OART) is a promising technique for delivering stereotactic accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI), as lumpectomy cavities vary in location and size between simulation and treatment. However, OART is resource-intensive, increasing planning and treatment times and decreasing machine throughput compared to the standard of care (SOC). Thus, it is pertinent to identify high-yield OART candidates to best allocate resources. &#xD;Approach. Reference plans (plans based on simulation anatomy), SOC plans (reference plans recalculated onto daily anatomy), and daily adaptive plans were analyzed for 31 sequential APBI targets, resulting in the analysis of 333 treatment plans. Spearman correlations between 22 reference plan metrics and 10 adaptive benefits, defined as the difference between mean SOC and delivered metrics, were analyzed to select a univariate predictor of OART benefit. A multivariate logistic regression model was then trained to stratify high- and low-benefit candidates.&#xD;Main Results. Adaptively delivered plans showed dosimetric benefit as compared to SOC plans for most plan metrics, although the degree of adaptive benefit varied per patient. The univariate model showed high likelihood for dosimetric adaptive benefit when the reference plan ipsilateral breast V15Gy exceeds 23.5%. Recursive feature elimination identified 5 metrics that predict high-dosimetric-benefit adaptive patients. Using leave-one-out cross validation, the univariate and multivariate models classified targets with 74.2% and 83.9% accuracy, resulting in improvement in per-fraction adaptive benefit between targets identified as high- and low-yield for 7/10 and 8/10 plan metrics, respectively. &#xD;Significance. This retrospective, exploratory study demonstrated that dosimetric benefit can be predicted using only ipsilateral breast V15 Gy on the reference treatment plan, allowing for a simple, interpretable model. Using multivariate logistic regression for adaptive benefit prediction led to increased accuracy at the cost of a more complicated model. This work presents a methodology for clinics wishing to triage OART resource allocation.&#xD.

    Title: A Comprehensive Review of Capsaicin and Its Role in Cancer Prevention and Treatment.
    Authors: Radhakrishna GK, Ammunje DN, Kunjiappan S, Ravi K, Vellingiri S, Ramesh SH, Almeida SD, Sireesha G, Ramesh S, Al-Qahtani S, Chidamabaram K, Theivendren P, Pavadai P
    Abstract: This study examines the fundamental chemical mechanisms responsible for capsaicin's advantageous impact on cancer, specifically investigating its influence on several biological processes such as inflammation in cancer metastasis, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and cellular proliferation. This entity's connections with other signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, NF-B, and TRPV channels, which have been linked to tumor growth, are thoroughly examined in this work. This study presents a thorough analysis of preclinical studies and clinical trials investigating the efficacy of capsaicin in treating many forms of cancer, such as breast, prostate, colorectal, pancreatic, and others. Through tests conducted in both live organisms and laboratory settings, it has been determined that capsaicin has the ability to inhibit tumor growth and induce apoptosis in cancer cells. (in vitro and in vivo). Researchers have also looked at the results of combining capsaicin with chemotherapy medications in traditional treatment. The efficacy and bioavailability of capsaicin as a viable medicinal drug are being studied, along with ways to improve its clinical value. The present investigation carefully assesses the challenges and potential options for maximizing the therapeutic benefits of capsaicin, including customized drug delivery and personalized therapeutic strategies. In finalization, this comprehensive investigation brings together the evidence currently obtainable on the anticancer properties of capsaicin, underscoring its potential as an autonomous treatment option in the struggle against cancer. Capsaicin is a compound of significant relevance for continuing research and clinical exploration in the field of cancer treatment due to its diverse mechanisms of action and ability for boosting prevailing therapy approaches.

    Title: Inhibition of protein translational machinery in triple-negative breast cancer as a promising therapeutic strategy.
    Authors: Dheeraj A, Garcia Marques FJ, Tailor D, Bermudez A, Resendez A, Pandrala M, Grau B, Kumar P, Haley CB, Honkala A, Kujur P, Jeffrey SS, Pitteri S, Malhotra SV
    Abstract: Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) is a proto-oncogenic protein associated with protein translation regulation. It plays a crucial role in the development and progression of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In this study, we describe a promising approach to inhibit YB-1 using SU056, a small-molecule inhibitor. SU056 physically interacts with YB-1 and reduces its expression, which helps to restrain the progression of TNBC. Proteome profiling analysis indicates that the inhibition of YB-1 by SU056 can alter the proteins that regulate protein translation, an essential process for cancer cell growth. Preclinical studies on human cells, mice, and patient-derived xenograft tumor models show the effectiveness of SU056. Moreover, toxicological studies have shown that SU056 treatment and dosing are well tolerated without any adverse effects. Overall, our study provides a strong foundation for the further development of SU056 as a potential treatment option for patients with TNBC by targeting YB-1.

    Abstract: Chemotherapy associated with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors is currently the standard of care in several tumor indications. This combination approach improves progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and complete pathological response (pCR) in several cancer types both in the early and metastatic approaches. However, the distinct spectrum of toxicities between cytotoxic side effects and immune related adverse events (irAEs) with similar clinical presentations and different management strategies remains a challenge in daily practice for healthcare professionals. This review summarizes the most common toxicities reported in the randomized clinical trials that led to the subsequent FDA approval of these combinations, across tumor indications. We cite in particular: non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, triple negative breast cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, gastric carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, cervical carcinoma and biliary tract carcinoma. We found that the combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy was associated with an increased incidence of all grade adverse events (RR 1.11 [1.09; 1.12]) without an excess in treatment related mortality when compared to chemotherapy alone. We report also an increase in the incidence of serious adverse events (grade >/= 3) (RR 1.16 [1.10;1.24]); in particular: high grade diarrhea, dyspnea, fatigue, rash and elevated liver enzymes. Together with the collaboration of our institutional network of organ specialists with expertise in irAEs, we propose practical recommendations for physicians to enhance clinical care and management of patients undergoing treatment with combined ICI immunotherapy and chemotherapy.

    Title: Immediate lymphatic reconstruction: Lessons learned over eight years.
    Authors: Friedman R, Ismail Aly MA, Fanning JE, Pardo JA, Johnson AR, Lee BT, James T, Singhal D
    Abstract: Immediate lymphatic reconstruction (ILR) is recognized as a surgical approach used to reduce the risk of developing secondary lymphedema, and evidence demonstrating the efficacy of ILR is favorable. Our Lymphatic Center has become a centralized location offering ILR for the risk-reduction in breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) in New England. Over the course of our experience, we made several modifications and adapted our approach to enhance the operative success of this procedure. These include advancements in our use of indocyanine green (ICG) imaging to identify baseline lymphatic anatomical variation, utilization of fluorescein isothiocyanate for lymphatic vessel visualization, application of the lymphosome concept to guide arm injection sites, verification of anastomotic patency (using ICG), localization of reconstruction to guide radiation therapy, incorporation of intraoperative tools to facilitate better anatomic visualization of the axilla, and addition of a lower extremity vein graft to mitigate venous-related complications. Collecting information from each surgery in a standardized manner, including intraoperative lymphatic channel measurements, and deploying clips for possible future radiation exposure, enables future studies on ILR patient outcomes. In this contribution, we aimed to share our institutional modifications with the surgical community to facilitate further adoption, conversation, and advancement of ILR for the risk-reduction in BCRL.

    Title: The ERK inhibitor GDC-0994 selectively inhibits growth of BRAF mutant cancer cells.
    Authors: Chen Y, Sang Y, Li S, Xue J, Chen M, Hong S, Lv W, Sehgal K, Xiao H, Liu R
    Abstract: BRAF or RAS mutation-induced aberrant activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is frequently observed in human cancers. As the key downstream node of MAPK pathway, ERK1/2 is as an important therapeutic target. GDC-0994 (ravoxertinib), an orally bioavailable, highly selective small-molecule inhibitor of ERK1/2, showed acceptable safety and pharmacodynamic profile in a recent phase I clinical trial. In this study, we investigated dependence of the anti-tumor effect of ERK inhibitor GDC-0994 on genetic alterations in the MAPK pathway. The results showed that GDC-0994 sharply inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation and induced remarkable G1 phase cell-cycle arrest in cancer cells harboring BRAF mutation but had little effect on cell behaviors in most RAS mutant or wild-type cell lines. The expression of a large number of genes, particularly the genes in the cell cycle pathway, were significantly changed after GDC-0994 treatment in BRAF mutant cells, while no remarkable expression change of such genes was observed in wild-type cells. Moreover, GDC-0994 selectively inhibited tumor growth in a BRAF mutant xenograft mice model. Our findings demonstrate a BRAF mutation-dependent anti-tumor effect of GDC-0994 and provide a rational strategy for patient selection for ERK1/2 inhibitor treatment.

    Title: Psychotropic Medication Prescriptions for Home-Based Palliative Care Oncology Patients.
    Authors: Mohamed F, Uvais NA, Moideen S, Cp RR, Saif M
    Abstract: Objective: To examine the complexities of psychotropic medication prescription in home-based palliative care for oncology patients. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 125 medical records of patients receiving palliative home care for cancer was conducted at a tertiary hospital, with a specific focus on the prescription patterns of psychotropic medications. The data were collected in September 2023. Results: Among 125 cases, the mean age was 64.4 +/- 14.9 years, with 50.4% females. Breast cancer (14.4%) and lung cancer (13.6%) were the most common diagnoses. Psychotropic medication was administered to 35.2% of patients. Treatment was initiated by palliative care doctors in 75% of cases, while psychiatrists handled 25%. Medication selection was predominantly symptom driven (63%), with anxiety prompting benzodiazepine prescriptions in 50% of cases, depression resulting in antidepressant use in 22%, and psychosis leading to antipsychotic treatment in 18%. Specific diagnoses were the target in only 36% of prescriptions, with delirium (27%) being the most prevalent, followed by depression and bipolar disorder. Benzodiazepines were the most commonly prescribed class of medications (56.8%), with clonazepam being the most prevalent (40.9%), followed by alprazolam and lorazepam (15.9%). Atypical antipsychotics made up 43.1% of prescriptions, with quetiapine being the most frequently prescribed (34%), along with olanzapine and risperidone (11%). Antidepressants accounted for 31.8% of prescriptions, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors at 18% and mirtazapine and amitriptyline at 6% each. Haloperidol, a typical antipsychotic, was prescribed in 13.6% of cases. Polypharmacy was observed in 35.6% of patients. Conclusion: In palliative home care, psychotropic medications are frequently prescribed by palliative doctors primarily for symptom management, with limited psychiatric consultations and challenges in accessing psychological evaluations. Collaborative efforts among regional or institutional medical bodies, including psychiatrists, psychologists, palliative doctors, and social workers, are needed to establish ethical guidelines for appropriate and effective psychotropic prescription.

    Title: A beta-Carboline Derivate PAD4 Inhibitor Reshapes Neutrophil Phenotype and Improves the Tumor Immune Microenvironment against Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.
    Authors: Zhu D, Lu Y, Yan Z, Deng Q, Hu B, Wang Y, Wang W, Wang Y, Wang Y
    Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer is a highly aggressive and heterogeneous breast cancer subtype characterized by early metastasis, poor prognosis, and high recurrence. Targeting histone citrullination-mediated chromatin dysregulation to induce epigenetic alterations shows great promise in TNBC therapy. We report the synthesis, optimization, and evaluation of a novel series of beta-carboline-derived peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 inhibitors that exhibited potent inhibition of TNBC cell proliferation. The most outstanding PAD4 inhibitor, compound 28, hindered the PAD4-H3cit-NET signaling pathway and inhibited the growth of solid tumors and pulmonary metastatic nodules in the 4T1 in situ mouse model. Furthermore, 28 improved the tumor immune microenvironment by reshaping neutrophil phenotype, upregulating the proportions of dendritic cells and M1 macrophages, and reducing the amount of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. In conclusion, our work offered 28 as an efficacious PAD4 inhibitor that exerts a combination of conventional chemotherapy and immune-boosting effects, which represents a potential therapy strategy for TNBC.

    Title: Edema of the upper extremity on the unaffected side in unilateral breast cancer patients.
    Authors: Kim JH, Seong ST, Lee JH, Kim GC, Jeong HJ, Sim YJ
    Abstract: Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) occurs usually on the affected side, and its cause and pathophysiology are well known. However, the cause of edema of the upper extremity on the unaffected side is barely known. It is often considered to be chemotherapy-induced general edema, and clinical evaluation is rarely performed in these patients. This study aimed to present the clinical characteristics of unilateral breast cancer patients with edema of upper extremity on the unaffected side, and to emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and medical interventions. This study retrospectively analyzed the medical records of unilateral breast cancer patients complaining edema of upper extremity on the unaffected side, from January 2020 to May 2021. Lymphoscintigraphy was used to assist in confirming the diagnosis of lymphedema, and Doppler ultrasonography or 3D computed tomography angiography were performed to differentiate vascular problems. Fourteen patients were enrolled in the study. Seven, 3, and 4 patients had edema of both upper extremities, edema of the upper extremity on the unaffected side only, and edema of all extremities, respectively. None of the 4 patients with edema of all extremities showed abnormal findings on examination. In patients with edema in the upper extremity on the unaffected side alone, lymphatic flow dysfunction was seen in 2 patients, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was diagnosed in 1. In patients with edema of both upper extremities, lymphatic flow dysfunction was seen in 2 patients, and DVT was diagnosed in 3. One patient had DVT and accompanying lymphatic flow dysfunction. Lymphedema and DVT were diagnosed in a number of patients with edema of the upper extremity on the unaffected side, and lymphedema can occur without direct injury to the lymphatic flow system. Therefore, clinicians should not overlook the fact that diseases that require early diagnosis and treatment can occur in patients with edema of the unaffected upper extremity.

    Title: Identification and validation of a prognostic anoikis-related gene signature in papillary thyroid carcinoma by integrated analysis of single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing.
    Authors: Zheng K, Zhang XX, Yu X, Yu B, Yang YF
    Abstract: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) prognosis may be deteriorated due to the metastases, and anoikis palys an essential role in the tumor metastasis. However, the potential effect of anoikis-related genes on the prognosis of PTC was unclear. The mRNA and clinical information were obtained from the cancer genome atlas database. Hub genes were identified and risk model was constructed using Cox regression analysis. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curve was applied for the survival analysis. Immune infiltration and immune therapy response were calculated using CIBERSORT and TIDE. The identification of cell types and cell interaction was performed by Seurat, SingleR and CellChat packages. GO, KEGG, and GSVA were applied for the enrichment analysis. Protein-protein interaction network was constructed in STRING and Cytoscape. Drug sensitivity was assessed in GSCA. Based on bulk RNA data, we identified 4 anoikis-related risk signatures, which were oncogenes, and constructed a risk model. The enrichment analysis found high risk group was enriched in some immune-related pathways. High risk group had higher infiltration of Tregs, higher TIDE score and lower levels of monocytes and CD8 T cells. Based on scRNA data, we found that 4 hub genes were mainly expressed in monocytes and macrophages, and they interacted with T cells. Hub genes were significantly related to immune escape-related genes. Drug sensitivity analysis suggested that cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A may be a better chemotherapy target. We constructed a risk model which could effectively and steadily predict the prognosis of PTC. We inferred that the immune escape may be involved in the development of PTC.

    Title: Identification of the new molecular subtypes related to inflammation in breast cancer.
    Authors: Yu K, Xu C, Wang F, Wang H
    Abstract: Breast cancer is a prevalent ailment among women, and the inflammatory response plays a crucial role in the management and prediction of breast cancer (BRCA). However, the new subtypes based on inflammation in BRCA research are still undefined. The databases including The Cancer Genome Atlas and gene expression omnibus were utilized to gather clinical data and somatic mutation information for approximately 1069 BRCA patients. Through Consensus Clustering, novel subtypes linked to inflammation were identified. A comparative analysis was conducted on the prognosis, and immune cell infiltration, and somatic mutation of the new subtypes. Additionally, an investigation into drug therapy and immunotherapy was conducted to distinguish high-risk individuals from low-risk ones. The findings of this investigation proposed the categorization of BRCA into innovative subtypes predicated on the inflammatory response and 6 key genes were a meaningful approach. Specifically, the low-, medium-, and high-inflammation subtypes exhibited varying degrees of association with clinicopathological features, tumor microenvironment, and prognosis. Notably, the high-inflammation subtype was characterized by a strong correlation with immunosuppressive microenvironments and a higher frequency of somatic mutations, which was an indication of poorer health. This study revealed that a brand-new classification could throw new light on the effective prognosis. The integration of multiple key genes was a new characterization that could promote more immunotherapy strategies and contribute to predicting the efficacy of the chemotherapeutic drugs.

    Title: Cancer-associated fibroblast-derived gene signature discriminates distinct prognoses by integrated single-cell and bulk RNA-seq analyses in breast cancer.
    Authors: Fang Z, Han YL, Gao ZJ, Yao F
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are one of the most predominant cellular subpopulations in the tumor stroma and play an integral role in cancer occurrence and progression. However, the prognostic role of CAFs in breast cancer remains poorly understood. METHODS: We identified a number of CAF-related biomarkers in breast cancer by combining single-cell and bulk RNA-seq analyses. Based on univariate Cox regression as well as Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analysis, a novel CAF-associated prognostic model was developed. Breast cancer patients were grouped according to the median risk score and further analyzed for outcome, clinical characteristic, pathway activity, genomic feature, immune landscape, and drug sensitivity. RESULTS: A total of 341 CAF-related biomarkers were identified from single-cell and bulk RNA-seq analyses. We eventually screened eight candidate prognostic genes, including CERCAM, EMP1, SDC1, PRKG1, XG, TNN, WLS, and PDLIM4, and constructed the novel CAF-related prognostic model. Grouped by the median risk score, high-risk patients showed a significantly worse prognosis and exhibited distinct pathway activities such as uncontrolled cell cycle progression, angiogenesis, and activation of glycolysis. In addition, the combined risk score and tumor mutation burden significantly improved the ability to predict patient prognosis. Importantly, patients in the high-risk group had a higher infiltration of M2 macrophages and a lower infiltration of CD8(+) T cells and activated NK cells. Finally, we calculated the IC50 for a range of anticancer drugs and personalized the treatment regimen for each patient. CONCLUSION: Integrating single-cell and bulk RNA-seq analyses, we identified a list of compositive CAF-associated biomarkers and developed a novel CAF-related prognostic model for breast cancer. This robust CAF-derived gene signature acts as an excellent predictor of patient outcomes and treatment responses in breast cancer.

    Title: "Hearing the pupils' voices through my own struggles": A qualitative study of return to work among school counselors who are breast cancer survivors.
    Authors: Levkovich I, Rosman L, Signorelli C
    Abstract: For breast cancer survivors, returning to work is an important step for their personal, financial, and psycho-social recovery. Returning to work as a school counselor can be particularly challenging because of the demands of their job and stress at work. This qualitative study examines return to work among school counselors who are breast cancer survivors. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 28 survivors of breast cancer stages I-III between the ages of 32 and 55, and up to ten years after the completion of chemotherapy. Interviews focused on the discovery of the illness, treatment period, ramifications of the diagnosis on various aspects of life, and implications for work. Using thematic analysis of the data collected, analysis of the findings revealed three key themes: 1) "Everyone is replaceable": The significance of disruptions in work continuity for school counselors who are breast cancer survivors. 2) "From Zero to a Hundred": Challenges Faced by Counselors in Returning to Work after Breast Cancer Recovery.3) "It's hard to listen to counselees' problems when I am immersed in my own crisis": How surviving breast cancer affects return to work among school counselors. Findings highlight the unique needs of these counselors and the challenges they face upon returning to work. The study discusses recommendations for school principals including training, advocacy, and awareness to support survivors and improve their return to work.

    Title: Effects of CD44 siRNA on inhibition, survival, and apoptosis of breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and 4T1).
    Authors: Dehbokri SG, Noorolyai S, Baghbani E, Moghaddamneshat N, Javaheri T, Baradaran B
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers in the world. Despite the many advances that have been made in treating patients, many patients are still resistant to treatment. CD44 is one of the surface glycoproteins of BC cells that plays an important role in the proliferation of these cells and inhibition of their apoptosis. Therefore, targeting it can be a treatment way for BC patients. METHODS: In this study, the effect of anti-CD44 siRNA on the proliferation, apoptosis, and migration rate of MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells was investigated. The techniques used in this study were MTT assay, RT-PCR, and flow cytometry. RESULTS: The apoptosis and proliferation rates in CD44 siRNA-treated cells were higher and lower, respectively, compared to untreated cells. Also, cell migration was less in treated cells compared to untreated cells. CD44 siRNA also decreased the expression of CXCR4, c-myc, Vimentin, ROCK, and MMP-9. CONCLUSION: Finally, CD44 targeting can be a good treatment option to make BC cells more sensitive to apoptosis.

    Title: Do we need reshape rTNM staging system for ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence of breast cancer? A population-based, propensity score matched cohort study.
    Authors: Zhang S, Yang H, Xu Y, Wang S
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to explore the role of recurrent TNM (rTNM) staging in predicting prognosis for ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) and determine the optimal treatment strategy for IBTR. METHOD: IBTR cases were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database spanning the years 2000-2018. Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to examine factors associated with overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS). Propensity score matching (PSM) was employed to match IBTR with primary early breast cancer (EBC) based on clinicopathological characteristics. Investigations into the impact of different therapies were also included. RESULTS: Of the 4375 IBTR cases included in the study, the 5-year OS was 87.1%, 71.6% and 58.7% in rTNM stages I, II and III, respectively. After PSM, while IBTR patients had worse survival to primary EBC patients, prognosis of IBTR for different rTNM stage always closely aligned with the corresponding stage of primary EBC. Repeat breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with radiation therapy was equivalent to mastectomy with respect to OS and BCSS. Chemotherapy was favorable for OS and BCSS in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative IBTR or IBTR occurring within a 60-month interval. CONCLUSIONS: rTNM staging system has an outstanding prognostic value for survival outcome of patients with IBTR, and IBTR and primary EBC may have potentially analogous features in the context of TNM staging. BCS plus radiation therapy may be an alternative. IBTR cases who have experienced recurrence with short intervals and with ER-negative tumors might benefit from chemotherapy.

    Title: Breast Cancer Immune Landscape: Interplay Between Systemic and Local Immunity.
    Authors: Gerashchenko T, Frolova A, Patysheva M, Fedorov A, Stakheyeva M, Denisov E, Cherdyntseva N
    Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common malignancies in women worldwide. Numerous studies in immuno-oncology and successful trials of immunotherapy have demonstrated the causal role of the immune system in cancer pathogenesis. The interaction between the tumor and the immune system is known to have a dual nature. Despite cytotoxic lymphocyte activity against transformed cells, a tumor can escape immune surveillance and leverage chronic inflammation to maintain its own development. Research on antitumor immunity primarily focuses on the role of the tumor microenvironment, whereas the systemic immune response beyond the tumor site is described less thoroughly. Here, a comprehensive review of the formation of the immune profile in breast cancer patients is offered. The interplay between systemic and local immune reactions as self-sustaining mechanism of tumor progression is described and the functional activity of the main cell populations related to innate and adaptive immunity is discussed. Additionally, the interaction between different functional levels of the immune system and their contribution to the development of the pro- or anti-tumor immune response in BC is highlighted. The presented data can potentially inform the development of new immunotherapy strategies in the treatment of patients with BC.

    Title: Psychosocial and supportive care concerns of young women living with advanced breast cancer: baseline findings from a prospective virtual support intervention study.
    Authors: Dibble KE, Rosenberg SM, Zheng Y, Sella T, Poorvu P, Snow C, Darai S, Rene C, Mack JW, Partridge AH
    Abstract: PURPOSE: Adolescent and young adults (AYAs) with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) experience high physical and psychosocial burdens compounded by a disrupted life trajectory. We sought to determine the psychosocial and supportive care concerns of this population to better understand and address unmet needs. METHODS: AYAs diagnosed with MBC (18-39 years) participating in a prospective interventional study (Young, Empowered, and Strong) at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute completed an electronic survey following enrollment. Measures evaluated sociodemographics, health behaviors, quality of life, and symptoms, among others. We used two-sided Fisher's exact tests to determine associations between concerns (e.g., cancer progression, side effects, lifestyle, finances, fertility) and demographic variables. RESULTS: Among 77 participants enrolled from 9/2020-12/2022, average age at MBC diagnosis and survey was 35.9 (range: 22-39) and 38.3 years (range: 27-46), respectively. Most were non-Hispanic white (83.8%) and 40.3% reported their diagnosis caused some financial problems. Many were concerned about fertility (27.0%), long-term treatment side effects (67.6%), exercise (61.6%), and diet (54.1%). Select concerns varied significantly by age, race/ethnicity, and education. Younger women at survey reported greater concern about familial cancer risk (p = 0.028). Women from minority racial/ethnic groups more frequently reported issues talking about their cancer to family/friends (p = 0.040) while those with more education were more frequently concerned with long-term effects of cancer on their health (p = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Young women living with MBC frequently report psychosocial, health, and cancer management concerns. Tailoring supportive care and communications to address prevalent concerns including disease progression and treatment side effects may optimize wellbeing.

    Title: Breast lymphomas: Clinical and pathological insights from a tertiary cancer care center in India.
    Authors: Singh N, Hayat S, Kumar S, Chowdhury Z, Dhal I, Patne SC, Kadali K, Mishra BK, Kapoor A, Gupta A, Singh A, Sansar B
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Breast lymphomas are a rare group of malignancies that are further subdivided into primary and secondary. AIMS: To study the pathological and clinical course of breast lymphomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of patients treated at our institute over a period of 4.5 years from September 2018 to February 2023. The details of all the patients diagnosed with breast lymphoma were reviewed and analysed for the histomorphological, immunohistochemical, clinical, and treatment details. Appropriate statistical analysis including Kaplan-Meier methods was used. RESULTS: Out of 11 cases of breast lymphoma, five were primary and six were secondary. It was seen predominantly in females (82%) and the age range was 31 to 73 years. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was the predominant morphology (73%), along with single rare cases of ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and small lymphocytic lymphoma. The treatment details were analyzed for 7 patients. The median follow-up was 28 months. Rituximab along with CHOP regimen or its variants was commonly used as first-line treatment with initial response rates of 71%. The median progression-free survival was 5 months. The median overall survival was 15 months. CONCLUSION: Lymphomas of the breast are rare but it is crucial to differentiate them from the commoner breast carcinomas as the treatment and prognosis vary vastly.

    Title: Towards a More Efficient Breast Cancer Therapy Using Active Human Cell Membrane-Coated Metal-Organic Frameworks.
    Authors: Gravan P, Rojas S, Picchi DF, Galisteo-Gonzalez F, Horcajada P, Marchal JA
    Abstract: The recent description of well-defined molecular subtypes of breast cancer has led to the clinical development of a number of successful molecular targets. Particularly, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive type of breast cancer with historically poor outcomes, mainly due to the lack of effective targeted therapies. Recent progresses in materials science have demonstrated the impressive properties of metal-organic framework nanoparticles (NPs) as antitumoral drug delivery systems. Here, in a way to achieve efficient bio-interfaces with cancer cells and improve their internalization, benchmarked MIL-100(Fe) NPs were coated with cell membranes (CMs) derived from the human TNBC cell line MDA-MB-468. The prepared CMs-coated metal-organic framework (CMs_MIL-100(Fe)) showed enhanced colloidal stability, cellular uptake, and cytotoxicity in MDA-MB-468 cells compared to non-coated NPs, paving the way for these human CMs-coated MIL-100(Fe) NPs as effective targeted therapies against the challenging TNBC.

    Title: Shared decision-making for supporting women's decisions about breast cancer screening.
    Authors: Riganti P, Ruiz Yanzi MV, Escobar Liquitay CM, Sgarbossa NJ, Alarcon-Ruiz CA, Kopitowski KS, Franco JV
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: In breast cancer screening programmes, women may have discussions with a healthcare provider to help them decide whether or not they wish to join the breast cancer screening programme. This process is called shared decision-making (SDM) and involves discussions and decisions based on the evidence and the person's values and preferences. SDM is becoming a recommended approach in clinical guidelines, extending beyond decision aids. However, the overall effect of SDM in women deciding to participate in breast cancer screening remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of SDM on women's satisfaction, confidence, and knowledge when deciding whether to participate in breast cancer screening. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 8 August 2023. We also screened abstracts from two relevant conferences from 2020 to 2023. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs assessing interventions targeting various components of SDM. The focus was on supporting women aged 40 to 75 at average or above-average risk of breast cancer in their decision to participate in breast cancer screening. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and conducted data extraction, risk of bias assessment, and GRADE assessment of the certainty of the evidence. Review outcomes included satisfaction with the decision-making process, confidence in the decision made, knowledge of all options, adherence to the chosen option, women's involvement in SDM, woman-clinician communication, and mental health. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 19 studies with 64,215 randomised women, mostly with an average to moderate risk of breast cancer. Two studies covered all aspects of SDM; six examined shortened forms of SDM involving communication on risks and personal values; and 11 focused on enhanced communication of risk without other SDM aspects. SDM involving all components compared to control The two eligible studies did not assess satisfaction with the SDM process or confidence in the decision. Based on a single study, SDM showed uncertain effects on participant knowledge regarding the age to start screening (risk ratio (RR) 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 2.28; 133 women; very low certainty evidence) and frequency of testing (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.04; 133 women; very low certainty evidence). Other review outcomes were not measured. Abbreviated forms of SDM with clarification of values and preferences compared to control Of the six included studies, none evaluated satisfaction with the SDM process. These interventions may reduce conflict in the decision made, based on two measures, Decisional Conflict Scale scores (mean difference (MD) -1.60, 95% CI -4.21 to 0.87; conflict scale from 0 to 100; 4 studies; 1714 women; very low certainty evidence) and the proportion of women with residual conflict compared to control at one to three months' follow-up (rate of women with a conflicted decision, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.99; 1 study; 1001 women, very low certainty evidence). Knowledge of all options was assessed through knowledge scores and informed choice. The effect of SDM may enhance knowledge (MDs ranged from 0.47 to 1.44 higher scores on a scale from 0 to 10; 5 studies; 2114 women; low certainty evidence) and may lead to higher rates of informed choice (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.63; 4 studies; 2449 women; low certainty evidence) compared to control at one to three months' follow-up. These interventions may result in little to no difference in anxiety (MD 0.54, 95% -0.96 to 2.14; scale from 20 to 80; 2 studies; 749 women; low certainty evidence) and the number of women with worries about cancer compared to control at four to six weeks' follow-up (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.06; 1 study, 639 women; low certainty evidence). Other review outcomes were not measured. Enhanced communication about risks without other SDM aspects compared to control Of 11 studies, three did not report relevant outcomes for this review, and none assessed satisfaction with the SDM process. Confidence in the decision made was measured by decisional conflict and anticipated regret of participating in screening or not. These interventions, without addressing values and preferences, may result in lower confidence in the decision compared to regular communication strategies at two weeks' follow-up (MD 2.89, 95% CI -2.35 to 8.14; Decisional Conflict Scale from 0 to 100; 2 studies; 1191 women; low certainty evidence). They may result in higher anticipated regret if participating in screening (MD 0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.41) and lower anticipated regret if not participating in screening (MD -0.28, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.14). These interventions increase knowledge (MD 1.14, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.62; scale from 0 to 10; 4 studies; 2510 women; high certainty evidence), while it is unclear if there is a higher rate of informed choice compared to regular communication strategies at two to four weeks' follow-up (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.92; 2 studies; 1805 women; low certainty evidence). These interventions result in little to no difference in anxiety (MD 0.33, 95% CI -1.55 to 0.99; scale from 20 to 80) and depression (MD 0.02, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.45; scale from 0 to 21; 2 studies; 1193 women; high certainty evidence) and lower cancer worry compared to control (MD -0.17, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.08; scale from 1 to 4; 1 study; 838 women; high certainty evidence). Other review outcomes were not measured. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Studies using abbreviated forms of SDM and other forms of enhanced communications indicated improvements in knowledge and reduced decisional conflict. However, uncertainty remains about the effect of SDM on supporting women's decisions. Most studies did not evaluate outcomes considered important for this review topic, and those that did measured different concepts. High-quality randomised trials are needed to evaluate SDM in diverse cultural settings with a focus on outcomes such as women's satisfaction with choices aligned to their values.

    Title: Novel carbamodithioate regulates cellular hypoxia through chemical activation of prolyl hydroxylase-2 for breast cancer chemoprevention.
    Authors: Rastogi S, Ansari MN, Saeedan AS, Yadav S, Kumar D, Singh SK, Mukerjee A, Singh M, Kaithwas G
    Abstract: Inhibition of prolylhydroxylase-2 (PHD-2) in both normoxic and hypoxic cells is a critical component of solid tumours. The present study aimed to identify small molecules with PHD-2 activation potential. Virtually screening 4342 chemical compounds for structural similarity to R59949 and docking with PHD-2. To find the best drug candidate, hits were assessed for drug likeliness, antihypoxic and antineoplastic potential. The selected drug candidate's PHD-2 activation, cytotoxic and apoptotic potentials were assessed using 2-oxoglutarate, MTT, AO/EtBr and JC-1 staining. The drug candidate was also tested for its in-vivo chemopreventive efficacy against DMBA-induced mammary gland cancer alone and in combination with Tirapazamine (TPZ). Virtual screening and 2-oxoglutarate assay showed BBAP-6 as lead compound. BBAP-6 exhibited cytotoxic and apoptotic activity against ER+ MCF-7. In carmine staining and histology, BBAP-6 alone or in combination with TPZ restored normal surface morphology of the mammary gland after DMBA produced malignant alterations. Immunoblotting revealed that BBAP-6 reduced NF-kappaB expression, activated PHD-2 and induced intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Serum metabolomics conducted with 1H NMR confirmed that BBAP-6 prevented HIF-1alpha and NF-kappaB-induced metabolic changes in DMBA mammary gland cancer model. In a nutshell, it can be concluded that BBAP-6 activates PHD-2 and exhibits anticancer potential.

    Title: Use of MRI Radiomics Models in Evaluating the Low HER2 Expression in Breast Cancer.
    Authors: Li H, Hou Y, Xue LY, Fan WL, Gao BL, Yin XP
    Abstract: To investigate the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomics models in evaluating the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2(HER2) expression in breast cancer. <P> Materials and Methods: The MRI data of 161 patients with invasive ductal carcinoma (non-special type) of breast cancer were retrospectively collected, and the MRI radiomics models were established based on the MRI imaging features of the fat suppression T2 weighted image (T2WI) sequence, dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-T1WIsequence and joint sequences. The T-test and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm were used for feature dimensionality reduction and screening, respectively, and the random forest (RF) algorithm was used to construct the classification model. <P> Results: The model established by the LASSO-RF algorithm was used in the ROC curve analysis. In predicting the low expression state of HER2 in breast cancer, the radiomics models of the fat suppression T2WI sequence, DCE-T1WI sequence, and the combination of the two sequences showed better predictive efficiency. In the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for the verification set of low, negative, and positive HER2 expression, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) value was 0.81, 0.72, and 0.62 for the DCE-T1WI sequence model, 0.79, 0.65 and 0.77 for the T2WI sequence model, and 0.84, 0.73 and 0.66 for the joint sequence model, respectively. The joint sequence model had the highest AUC value. <P> Conclusions: The MRI radiomics models can be used to effectively predict the HER2 expression in breast cancer and provide a non-invasive and early assistant method for clinicians to formulate individualized and accurate treatment plans.

    Title: Estrogen signalling and Alzheimer's disease: Decoding molecular mechanisms for therapeutic breakthrough.
    Authors: Rishabh, Rohilla M, Bansal S, Bansal N, Chauhan S, Sharma S, Goyal N, Gupta S
    Abstract: In females, Alzheimer's disease (AD) incidences increases as compared to males due to estrogen deficiency after menopause. Estrogen therapy is the mainstay therapy for menopause and associated complications. Estrogen, a hormone with multifaceted physiological functions, has been implicated in AD pathophysiology. Estrogen plays a crucial role in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and overall neuronal health by regulating various factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), intracellular calcium signalling, death domain-associated protein (Daxx) translocation, glutamatergic excitotoxicity, Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel, Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 Receptor, estrogen-metabolising enzymes and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) protein polymorphisms. All these factors impact the physiology of postmenopausal women. Estrogen replacement therapies play an important treatment strategy to prevent AD after menopause. However, use of these therapies may lead to increased risks of breast cancer, venous thromboembolism and cardiovascular disease. Various therapeutic approaches have been used to mitigate the effects of estrogen on AD. These include hormone replacement therapy, Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs), Estrogen Receptor Beta (ERbeta)-Selective Agonists, Transdermal Estrogen Delivery, Localised Estrogen Delivery, Combination Therapies, Estrogen Metabolism Modulation and Alternative Estrogenic Compounds like genistein from soy, a notable phytoestrogen from plant sources. However, mechanism via which these approaches modulate AD in postmenopausal women has not been explained earlier thoroughly. Present review will enlighten all the molecular mechanisms of estrogen and estrogen replacement therapies in AD. Along-with this, the association between estrogen, estrogen-metabolising enzymes and ApoE protein polymorphisms will also be discussed in postmenopausal AD.

    Title: Preoperative Differentiation of HER2-Zero and HER2-Low from HER2-Positive Invasive Ductal Breast Cancers Using BI-RADS MRI Features and Machine Learning Modeling.
    Authors: Zhou J, Zhang Y, Miao H, Yoon GY, Wang J, Lin Y, Wang H, Liu YL, Chen JH, Pan Z, Su MY, Wang M
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Accurate determination of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is important for choosing optimal HER2 targeting treatment strategies. HER2-low is currently considered HER2-negative, but patients may be eligible to receive new anti-HER2 drug conjugates. PURPOSE: To use breast MRI BI-RADS features for classifying three HER2 levels, first to distinguish HER2-zero from HER2-low/positive (Task-1), and then to distinguish HER2-low from HER2-positive (Task-2). STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. POPULATION: 621 invasive ductal cancer, 245 HER2-zero, 191 HER2-low, and 185 HER2-positive. For Task-1, 488 cases for training and 133 for testing. For Task-2, 294 cases for training and 82 for testing. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3.0 T; 3D T1-weighted DCE, short time inversion recovery T2, and single-shot EPI DWI. ASSESSMENT: Pathological information and BI-RADS features were compared. Random Forest was used to select MRI features, and then four machine learning (ML) algorithms: decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and artificial neural nets (ANN), were applied to build models. STATISTICAL TESTS: Chi-square test, one-way analysis of variance, and Kruskal-Wallis test were performed. The P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. For ML models, the generated probability was used to construct the ROC curves. RESULTS: Peritumoral edema, the presence of multiple lesions and non-mass enhancement (NME) showed significant differences. For distinguishing HER2-zero from non-zero (low + positive), multiple lesions, edema, margin, and tumor size were selected, and the k-NN model achieved the highest AUC of 0.86 in the training set and 0.79 in the testing set. For differentiating HER2-low from HER2-positive, multiple lesions, edema, and margin were selected, and the DT model achieved the highest AUC of 0.79 in the training set and 0.69 in the testing set. DATA CONCLUSION: BI-RADS features read by radiologists from preoperative MRI can be analyzed using more sophisticated feature selection and ML algorithms to build models for the classification of HER2 status and identify HER2-low. TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.

    Title: Mapping the function of MicroRNAs as a critical regulator of tumor-immune cell communication in breast cancer and potential treatment strategies.
    Authors: Abdul Manap AS, Wisham AA, Wong FW, Ahmad Najmi HR, Ng ZF, Diba RS
    Abstract: Among women, breast cancer ranks as the most prevalent form of cancer, and the presence of metastases significantly reduces prognosis and diminishes overall survival rates. Gaining insights into the biological mechanisms governing the conversion of cancer cells, their subsequent spread to other areas of the body, and the immune system's monitoring of tumor growth will contribute to the advancement of more efficient and targeted therapies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a critical role in the interaction between tumor cells and immune cells, facilitating tumor cells' evasion of the immune system and promoting cancer progression. Additionally, miRNAs also influence metastasis formation, including the establishment of metastatic sites and the transformation of tumor cells into migratory phenotypes. Specifically, dysregulated expression of these genes has been associated with abnormal expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, thereby facilitating tumor development. This study aims to provide a concise overview of the significance and function of miRNAs in breast cancer, focusing on their involvement as tumor suppressors in the antitumor immune response and as oncogenes in metastasis formation. Furthermore, miRNAs hold tremendous potential as targets for gene therapy due to their ability to modulate specific pathways that can either promote or suppress carcinogenesis. This perspective highlights the latest strategies developed for miRNA-based therapies.

    Title: Transcriptomic analysis of GITR and GITR ligand reveals cancer immune heterogeneity with implications for GITR targeting.
    Authors: Moussa P, Kurzrock R, Nishizaki D, Miyashita H, Lee S, Nikanjam M, Pabla S, Nesline MK, Ko H, Conroy JM, DePietro P, Sicklick JK, Kato S
    Abstract: Glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor related protein (GITR) is a transmembrane protein expressed mostly on CD25(+)CD4(+) regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and upregulated on all T-cells upon activation. It is a T-cell co-stimulatory receptor and has demonstrated promising anti-tumor activity in pre-clinical studies. To date, however, the efficacy of GITR agonism has been discouraging in clinical trials. This study explores GITR and GITR ligand (GITR-L) ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression in solid tumors in an attempt to delineate causes for variable responses to GITR agonists. RNA expression levels of 514 patients with a variety of cancer types were normalized to internal housekeeping gene profiles and ranked as percentiles. 99/514 patients (19.3%) had high GITR expression (defined as >/= 75th percentile). Breast and lung cancer had the highest proportion of patients with high GITR expression (39% and 35%, respectively). The expression of concomitant high GITR and low-moderate GITR-L expression (defined as <75th percentile) was present in 31% and 30% of patients with breast and lung cancer respectively. High GITR expression also showed a significant independent association with high RNA expression of other immune modulator proteins, namely, PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) >/=1 (odds ratio (OR) 2.15, P=0.008), CTLA4 (OR=2.17, P=0.05) and OX40 high RNA expression (OR=2.64, P=0.001). Overall, these results suggest that breast and lung cancer have a high proportion of patients with a GITR and GITR-L RNA expression profile that merits further investigation in GITR agonism studies. The association of high GITR expression with high CTLA4 and OX40 RNA expression, as well as positive PD-L1 IHC, provides a rationale for a combination approach targeting these specific immune modulator proteins in patients whose tumors show such co-expression.

    Title: Development and validation of a random survival forest model for predicting long-term survival of early-stage young breast cancer patients based on the SEER database and an external validation cohort.
    Authors: Li LW, Liu X, Shen ML, Zhao MJ, Liu H
    Abstract: Young breast cancer (YBC) patients often face a poor prognosis, hence it's necessary to construct a model that can accurately predict their long-term survival in early stage. To realize this goal, we utilized data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) databases between January 2010 and December 2020, and meanwhile, enrolled an independent external cohort from Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital. The study aimed to develop and validate a prediction model constructed using the Random Survival Forest (RSF) machine learning algorithm. By applying the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analysis, we pinpointed key prognostic factors for YBC patients, which were used to create a prediction model capable of forecasting the 3-year, 5-year, 7-year, and 10-year survival rates of YBC patients. The RSF model constructed in the study demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving C-index values of 0.920 in the training set, 0.789 in the internal validation set, and 0.701 in the external validation set, outperforming the Cox regression model. The model's calibration was confirmed by Brier scores at various time points, showcasing its excellent accuracy in prediction. Decision curve analysis (DCA) underscored the model's importance in clinical application, and the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) plots highlighted the importance of key variables. The RSF model also proved valuable in risk stratification, which has effectively categorized patients based on their survival risks. In summary, this study has constructed a well-performed prediction model for the evaluation of prognostic factors influencing the long-term survival of early-stage YBC patients, which is significant in risk stratification when physicians handle YBC patients in clinical settings.

    Title: Synergistic induction of autophagy in gastric cancer by targeting CDK4/6 and MEK through AMPK/mTOR pathway.
    Authors: Zhou H, Li G, Kan L, Yang M, Liu Y, Miu X, Shi L, Yang Z, Zheng X, Chen H, Ren C
    Abstract: KRAS is a commonly mutated oncogene in human gastric cancer and is often associated with drug resistance and poor prognosis. Co-clinical trial of combined MEK-CDK4/6 inhibition in KRAS mutated cancers demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in patient-derived xenografts and safety in patients. Here, present research focuses on targeting CDK4/6 and MEK synergistically block the proliferation of KRAS-mutated gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo and induced autophagy through the AMPK/mTOR pathway. Furthermore, autophagy inhibitor combined with targeting CDK4/6 and MEK therapy had significant antitumor effects on KRAS mutant gastric cancer cells. Clinical trials are needed to determine the mechanism behind this finding and its clinical utility. In conclusion, our results demonstrate autophagy inhibitor combined targeting MEK and CDK4/6 that concurrently block multiple metabolic processes may be an effective therapeutic approach for gastric cancer.

    Title: Identification of molecular subtypes based on chromatin regulator-related genes and experimental verification of the role of ASCL1 in conferring chemotherapy resistance to breast cancer.
    Authors: Li Y, Yang X, Geng C, Liu Y, Tang T, Zhang L, Liu F, Zhang M, Hao J, Ma L
    Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the molecular subtypes of breast cancer based on chromatin regulator-related genes. METHODS: The RNA sequencing data of The Cancer Genome Atlas-Breast Cancer cohort were obtained from the official website, while the single-cell data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GSE176078). Validation was performed using the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium dataset. Furthermore, the immune characteristics, tumor stemness, heterogeneity, and clinical characteristics of these molecular subtypes were analyzed. The correlation between chromatin regulators and chemotherapy resistance was examined in vitro using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assays. RESULTS: This study identified three stable molecular subtypes with different prognostic and pathological features. Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and protein-protein interaction analyses revealed that the differentially expressed genes were associated with disease processes, such as mitotic nuclear division, chromosome segregation, condensed chromosome, and specific chromosome region. The T stage and subtypes were correlated with the clinical features. Tumor heterogeneity (mutant-allele tumor heterogeneity, tumor mutational burden, purity, and homologous recombination deficiency) and tumor stemness (RNA expression-based stemness score, epigenetically regulated RNA expression-based stemness score, DNA methylation-based stemness score, and epigenetically regulated DNA methylation-based stemness score) significantly varied between the three subtypes. Furthermore, Western blotting, qRT-PCR, and CCK8 assays demonstrated that the expression of ASCL1 was positively correlated with chemotherapy resistance in breast cancer. CONCLUSION: This study identified the subtypes of breast cancer based on chromatin regulators and analyzed their clinical features, gene mutation status, immunophenotype, and drug sensitivity. The results of this study provide effective strategies for assessing clinical prognosis and developing personalized treatment strategies.

    Title: Associations of serum cystatin C concentrations with total mortality and mortality of 12 site-specific cancers.
    Authors: Huang C, Lu J, Yang J, Wang Z, Hang D, Fu Z
    Abstract: PURPOSE: Cystatin C (CysC), beyond its biomarker role of renal function, has been implicated in various physical and pathological activities. However, the impact of serum CysC on cancer mortality in a general population remains unknown. We aimed to examine the associations of serum CysC concentrations with total mortality and mortality of 12 site-specific cancers. METHODS: We included 241,008 participants of the UK Biobank cohort with CysC measurements who had normal creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rates and were free of cancer and renal diseases at baseline (2006-2010). Death information was obtained from the National Health Service death records through 28 February 2021. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to compute hazard ratios (HR) per one standard deviation increase in log-transformed CysC concentrations and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for mortality. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 12.1 (interquartile range, 11.3-12.8) years, 5,744 cancer deaths occurred. We observed a positive association between serum CysC concentrations and total cancer mortality (HR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.12-1.20). Specifically, participants with higher serum CysC concentrations had increased mortality due to lung cancer (HR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.05-1.20), blood cancer (HR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.16-1.44), brain cancer (HR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.04-1.36), esophageal cancer (HR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.05-1.37), breast cancer (HR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.03-1.36), and liver cancer (HR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.31-1.69). CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that higher CysC concentrations are associated with increased mortality due to lung, blood, brain, esophageal, breast, and liver cancers. Future studies are necessary to clarify underlying mechanisms.

    Title: Nuclear Softness Promotes the Metastatic Potential of Large-Nucleated Colorectal Cancer Cells via the ErbB4-Akt1-Lamin A/C Signaling Pathway.
    Authors: Li Y, Li Q, Mu L, Hu Y, Yan C, Zhao H, Mi Y, Li X, Tao D, Qin J
    Abstract: Abnormal nuclear enlargement is a diagnostic and physical hallmark of malignant tumors. Large nuclei are positively associated with an increased risk of developing metastasis; however, a large nucleus is inevitably more resistant to cell migration due to its size. The present study demonstrated that the nuclear size of primary colorectal cancer (CRC) cells at an advanced stage was larger than cells at an early stage. In addition, the nuclei of CRC liver metastases were larger than those of the corresponding primary CRC tissues. CRC cells were sorted into large-nucleated cells (LNCs) and small-nucleated cells (SNCs). Purified LNCs exhibited greater constricted migratory and metastatic capacity than SNCs in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, ErbB4 was highly expressed in LNCs, which phosphorylated lamin A/C at serine 22 via the ErbB4-Akt1 signaling pathway. Furthermore, the level of phosphorylated lamin A/C was a negative determinant of nuclear stiffness. Taken together, CRC LNCs possessed greater constricted migratory and metastatic potential than SNCs due to ErbB4-Akt1-mediated lamin A/C phosphorylation and nuclear softening. These results may provide a potential treatment strategy for tumor metastasis by targeting nuclear stiffness in patients with cancer, particularly CRC.

    Title: E3 ubiquitin ligase BCA2 promotes breast cancer stemness by up-regulation of SOX9 by LPS.
    Authors: Zheng M, Liu W, Zhang R, Jiang D, Shi Y, Wu Y, Ge F, Chen C
    Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most malignant subtype of breast cancer. Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are believed to play a crucial role in the carcinogenesis, therapy resistance, and metastasis of TNBC. It is well known that inflammation promotes stemness. Several studies have identified breast cancer-associated gene 2 (BCA2) as a potential risk factor for breast cancer incidence and prognosis. However, whether and how BCA2 promotes BCSCs has not been elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that BCA2 specifically promotes lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BCSCs through LPS induced SOX9 expression. BCA2 enhances the interaction between myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and inhibits the interaction of MyD88 with deubiquitinase OTUD4 in the LPS-mediated NF-kappaB signaling pathway. And SOX9, an NF-kappaB target gene, mediates BCA2's pro-stemness function in TNBC. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which BCA2 promotes breast cancer and potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of breast cancer.

    Title: Ciliogenesis-associated Kinase 1 Promotes Breast Cancer Cell Proliferation and Chemoresistance via Phosphorylating ERK1.
    Authors: He Y, Zhang X, Pan W, Zhang J, Zhu W, Zhang J, Shi J
    Abstract: Ciliogenesis-associated kinase 1 (CILK1) plays a key role in the ciliogenesis and ciliopathies. It remains totally unclear whether CILK1 is involved in tumor progression and therapy resistance. Here, we report that the aberrant high-expression of CILK1 in breast cancer is required for tumor cell proliferation and chemoresistance. Two compounds, CILK1-C30 and CILK1-C28, were identified with selective inhibitory effects towards the Tyr-159/Thr-157 dual-phosphorylation of CILK1, pharmacological inhibition of CILK1 significantly suppressed tumor cell proliferation and overcame chemoresistance in multiple experimental models. Large-scale screen of CILK1 substrates confirmed that the kinase directly phosphorylates ERK1, which is responsible for CILK1-mediated oncogenic function. CILK1 is also indicated to be responsible for the chemoresistance of small-cell lung cancer cells. Our data highlight the importance of CILK1 in cancer, implicating that targeting CILK1/ERK1 might offer therapeutic benefit to cancer patients.

    Title: Appendiceal Metastasis of Breast Cancer: A Case Report and a Literature Review.
    Authors: Yagyu T, Miki H, Kikawa Y, Kobayashi T, Sekimoto M
    Abstract: Appendiceal metastases of breast cancer (BC) are very rare, and there are few reports of resection. Asymptomatic appendiceal enlargement is often suspected to be a primary appendiceal tumor, making it difficult to suspect metastatic tumors, especially metastases from BC. On the other hand, advances in drug therapy, including hormonal therapy for BC, have prolonged survival, and there is a possibility of encountering metastatic cases that have rarely been seen before. We herein present a case in which an enlarged appendix, identified during hormonal therapy for advanced BC, was laparoscopically removed and diagnosed as BC metastasis. A 53-year-old woman had been diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) based on a breast biopsy, and the appendiceal specimen was diagnosed as invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). We herein report this unique case and provide a detailed review of 13 previous reports.

    Title: Geographic and Physician-Level Variation in the Use of Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Breast Cancer in the U.S.: A Cross-Classified Multilevel Analysis.
    Authors: Sun Y, Saulsberry L, Liao C, Hedeker D, Huo D
    Abstract: PURPOSE: We aimed to assess geographic and physician-level variation for hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation (HF-WBI) use for early-stage breast cancer patients in the United States. We further evaluated the association between HF-WBI use and demographic factors after accounting for these variations. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We performed a retrospective study of early-stage breast cancer patients using private employer-sponsored insurance claims from 2008 to 2017. Patients were clustered according to geographic level and by radiation oncologist. Bayesian cross-classified multilevel logistic models were used to examine the geographic heterogeneity and variation of radiation oncologists simultaneously. Intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) and median odds ratios (MOR) were calculated to quantify the variation at different levels. We also used the cross-classified model to identify patient demographic factors associated with receiving HF-WBI. RESULTS: The study included 79,747 women (74.0%) who received conventionally fractionated whole-breast irradiation (CF-WBI) and 27,999 women (26.0%) who underwent HF-WBI. HF-WBI adoption increased significantly across time (2008-2017). The variation in HF-WBI utilization was attributed mostly to physician-level variability (MOR = 2.59). The variability of HF-WBI utilization across core-based statistical areas (CBSAs) (MOR = 1.55) was found to be the strongest among all geographic classifications. After accounting for variability in both CBSAs and radiation oncologists, age, receiving chemotherapy, and several community-level factors, including distance from home to facility, community education level, and racial composition, were found to be associated with HF-WBI utilization. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated geographic and physician-level heterogeneity in the use of HF-WBI among early-stage breast cancer patients. HF-WBI utilization was also found to be associated with patient and community-level characteristics. Given observed physician-level variability, intervention through continuing medical education could help doctors to better understand the advantages of HF-WBI and promote the adoption of HF-WBI in the U.S. Influence of physician-level characteristics on HF-WBI utilization merits further study.

    Title: BRCA testing and management of BRCA-mutated early-stage breast cancer: a comprehensive statement by expert group from GCC region.
    Authors: Al-Shamsi HO, Alwbari A, Azribi F, Calaud F, Thuruthel S, Tirmazy SHH, Kullab S, Ostomane S, Abulkhair O
    Abstract: BReast CAncer (BRCA)1 and BRCA2 gene pathogenic variants account for most hereditary breast cancers (BC). Identification of BRCA mutations can significantly influence both prognosis and treatment outcomes. Furthermore, it enables the identification of individuals who are at heightened risk of developing BC due to inherited genetic mutations. Many developing countries rely on western guidelines for BRCA testing and BC management; however, there exist wide disparities in the prevalence of risk factors, availability of medical resources, and practice patterns. Guidelines tailored to specific regions can help mitigate healthcare variations, promote consistency in treatment, and aid healthcare providers in identifying effective therapies for improving patient outcomes. Hence, oncologists from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) congregated virtually in March 2023 and reviewed existing data on the epidemiology of BC, BRCA mutations, practices and challenges associated with BRCA testing and management of BRCA mutated early-stage BC in the GCC region. They also provided insights on the real-world diagnostic and treatment practices and challenges in the GCC region in the BRCA-mutated early-stage BC domain and suggested some variations to international guidelines to aid their uptake in this region.

    Title: Voluntary wheel running reduces tumor growth and increases capillarity in the heart during doxorubicin chemotherapy in a murine model of breast cancer.
    Authors: Uurasmaa TM, Ricardo C, Autio A, Heinonen IHA, Rundqvist H, Anttila K
    Abstract: Introduction: The possible beneficial effects of physical activity during doxorubicin treatment of breast cancer need further investigation as many of the existing studies have been done on non-tumor-bearing models. Therefore, in this study, we aim to assess whether short-term voluntary wheel-running exercise during doxorubicin treatment of breast cancer-bearing mice could induce beneficial cardiac effects and enhance chemotherapy efficacy. Methods: Murine breast cancer I3TC cells were inoculated subcutaneously to the flank of female FVB mice (n = 16) that were divided into exercised and non-exercised groups. Two weeks later, doxorubicin treatment was started via intraperitoneal administration (5 mg/kg weekly for 3 weeks). Organs were harvested a day after the last dose. Results: The tumor volume over time was significantly different between the groups, with the exercising group having lower tumor volumes. The exercised group had increased body weight gain, tumor apoptosis, capillaries per cardiomyocytes, and cardiac lactate dehydrogenase activity compared to the unexercised group, but tumor blood vessel density and maturation and tumor and cardiac HIF1-alpha and VEGF-A levels did not differ from those of the non-exercised group. Discussion: We conclude that even short-term light exercise such as voluntary wheel running exercise can decrease the subcutaneous mammary tumor growth, possibly via increased tumor apoptosis. The increase in cardiac capillaries per cardiomyocytes may also have positive effects on cancer treatment outcomes.

    Title: Gynecologic Care of Black Breast Cancer Survivors.
    Authors: Pleasant V
    Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Black patients suffer from breast cancer-related racial health disparities, which could have implications on their gynecologic care. This review explores considerations in the gynecologic care of Black breast cancer survivors. RECENT FINDINGS: Black people have a higher risk of leiomyoma and endometrial cancer, which could confound bleeding patterns such as in the setting of tamoxifen use. As Black people are more likely to have early-onset breast cancer, this may have implications on long-term bone and heart health. Black patients may be more likely to have menopausal symptoms at baseline and as a result of breast cancer treatment. Furthermore, Black patients are less likely to utilize assisted reproductive technology and genetic testing services. SUMMARY: It is important for healthcare providers to be well-versed in the intersections of breast cancer and gynecologic care. Black breast cancer survivors may have unique considerations for which practitioners should be knowledgeable.

    Title: Is Body Appreciation a Moderator of Women's Satisfaction and Distress with the Body Changes that Occur after Breast Cancer Surgery? A One-Year Longitudinal Study.
    Authors: Marco-Salvador JH, Castejon Raven J, Grau Sevilla MD, Ripoll Orts F
    Abstract: Women with breast cancer show dissatisfaction with their appearance, a perception of loss of femininity and bodily integrity, and dissatisfaction with the outcome of the surgery. Body Appreciation (BA) is defined as positive attitudes toward one's body, beyond satisfaction and dissatisfaction with one's appearance. Although studies about the protective role of BA have increased, to the best of our knowledge, there are no published studies on the association between BA, body dissatisfaction, and distress in participants with breast cancer. The aims of this study are: (a) To analyze whether BA is a moderator of satisfaction with the body from before breast surgery to the one-year follow-up; and (b) to analyze whether BA is a moderator of distress from before breast surgery to the one-year follow-up. The sample consisted of 115 women diagnosed with breast cancer. Several hierarchical regression analyses were conducted. The results indicated that BA moderated the association between the appearance evaluation before the surgery and the appearance evaluation 12 months after the surgery. Although BA was a significative predictor of distress, it was not a moderator of distress from the moment before breast surgery to the one-year follow-up. This study highlights the importance of evaluating the construct of BA in participants with breast cancer using longitudinal designs and developing psychological interventions that focus on increasing BA.

    Title: A Competing Risk Nomogram for Prediction of Prognosis in Patients With Primary Squamous Cell Thyroid Carcinoma.
    Authors: Tian Y, He L, Zhang B, Deng L, Wang J
    Abstract: Objective: Primary squamous cell thyroid carcinoma (PSCTC) is an extremely rare carcinoma, accounting for less than 1% of all thyroid carcinomas. However, the factors contributing to PSCTC outcomes remain unclear. This study aimed to identify the prognostic factors and develop a prognostic predictive model for patients with PSCTC. Methods: The analysis included patients diagnosed with thyroid carcinoma between 1975 and 2016 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Prognostic differences among the 5 pathological types of thyroid carcinomas were analyzed. To determine prognostic factors in PSCTC patients, the Cox regression model and Fine-Gray competing risk model were utilized. Based on the Fine-Gray competing risk model, a nomogram was established for predicting the prognosis of patients with PSCTC. Results: A total of 198,757 thyroid carcinoma patients, including 218 PSCTC patients, were identified. We found that PSCTC and anaplastic thyroid cancer had the worst prognosis among the 5 pathological types of thyroid carcinoma (P < .001). According to univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, age (71-95 years) was an independent risk factor for poorer overall survival and disease-specific survival in PSCTC patients. Using Fine-Gray regression analysis, the total number of in situ/malignant tumors for patient (Number 1) (>/=2) was identified as an independent protective factor for prognosis of PSCTC. The area under the curve, the concordance index (C-index), calibration curves and decision curve analysis revealed that the nomogram was capable of predicting the prognosis of PSCTC patients accurately. Conclusion: The competing risk nomogram is highly accurate in predicting prognosis for patients with PSCTC, which may help clinicians to optimize individualized treatment decisions.

    Title: The role of clinical breast examination and fine needle aspiration cytology in early detection of breast cancer: A cross-sectional study nested in a cohort in a low-resource setting.
    Authors: Mremi A, Pallangyo A, Mshana T, Mashauri O, Kimario W, Nkya G, Mwakyembe TE, Mollel E, Amsi P, Mmbaga BT
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is prevalent worldwide, with disparities in screening, diagnosis, treatment outcomes, and survival. In Africa, the majority of women are diagnosed at advanced stages, affecting treatment outcomes. Screening is one of the best strategies to reduce mortality rates caused by this cancer. Yet in a resource-constrained setting, there is limited access to screening and early detection services, which are available only at a few referral hospitals. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the prevalence and screening results of breast cancer using clinical breast examination coupled with fine needle aspiration cytology in a resource-constraint setting. DESIGN: A combined cross-sectional and cohort study. METHODS: Women at risk of developing breast cancer in the Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania were invited, through public announcements, to their primary healthcare facilities. A questionnaire was used to assess the participants' characteristics. The women received a clinical breast examination, and detectable lesions were subjected to a confirmatory fine needle aspiration cytology or an excisional biopsy. Preliminary data from this ongoing breast cancer control program were extracted and analyzed for this study. RESULTS: A total of 3577 women were screened for breast cancer; their mean age was 47 +/- 7.53 years. About a third of them (1145, 32%) were practicing self-breast examination at least once a month. Of 200 (5.6%) with abnormal clinical breast examination, 18 (9%) were confirmed to be breast cancer, making the prevalence to be 0.5%. The vast majority of participants with breast cancer (13, 72.2%) had early disease stages, and infiltrating ductal carcinoma, no special type, was the most common (15, 83.3%) histopathology subtype. Hormonal receptor status determination results indicated that 11 (61.1%), 7 (38.9%), and 5 (27.8%) of the tumors overexpressed estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal receptor-2, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates 5.6% of Tanzanian women have abnormal clinical breast examination findings, with 9% having breast cancer. Nearly three-quarters (72.2%) of breast cancer screened for early disease were detected in the early disease stages. This finding suggests that organized screening with clinical breast examination coupled with fine needle aspiration cytology, which is a simple and cost-effective screening method, has the potential to improve early detection and outcomes for breast cancer patients in a resource-constraint setting.

    Title: A 3'-pre-tRNA-derived small RNA tRF-1-Ser regulated by 25(OH)D promotes proliferation and stemness by inhibiting the function of MBNL1 in breast cancer.
    Authors: Wan X, Shi W, Ma L, Wang L, Zheng R, He J, Wang Y, Li X, Zha X, Wang J, Xu L
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: We explored the potential novel anticancer mechanisms of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), a vitamin D metabolite with antitumour effects in breast cancer. It is stable in serum and is used to assess vitamin D levels in clinical practice. Transfer RNA-derived small RNAs are small noncoding RNAs that generate various distinct biological functions, but more research is needed on their role in breast cancer. METHODS: Small RNA microarrays were used to explore the novel regulatory mechanism of 25(OH)D. High-throughput RNA-sequencing technology was used to detect transcriptome changes after 25(OH)D treatment and tRF-1-Ser knockdown. RNA pull-down and high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry were used to explore the proteins bound to tRF-1-Ser. In vitro and in vivo functional experiments were conducted to assess the influence of 25(OH)D and tRF-1-Ser on breast cancer. Semi-quantitative PCR was performed to detect alternative splicing events. Western blot assay and qPCR were used to assess protein and mRNA expression. RESULTS: The expression of tRF-1-Ser is negatively regulated by 25(OH)D. In our breast cancer (BRCA) clinical samples, we found that the expression of tRF-1-Ser was higher in cancer tissues than in paired normal tissues, and was significantly associated with tumour invasion. Moreover, tRF-1-Ser inhibits the function of MBNL1 by hindering its nuclear translocation. Functional experiments and transcriptome data revealed that the downregulation of tRF-1-Ser plays a vital role in the anticancer effect of 25(OH)D. CONCLUSIONS: In brief, our research revealed a novel anticancer mechanism of 25(OH)D, unveiled the vital function of tRF-1-Ser in BRCA progression, and suggested that tRF-1-Ser could emerge as a new therapeutic target for BRCA.

    Title: PD-L1 intrinsically promotes the proliferation of breast cancer cells through the SKP2-p27/p21 axis.
    Authors: Elfoly M, Mirza JY, Alaiya A, Al-Hazzani AA, Tulbah A, Al-Alwan M, Ghebeh H
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: PD-L1 intrinsically promotes tumor progression through multiple mechanisms, which potentially leads to resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. The intrinsic effect of PD-L1 on breast cancer (BC) cell proliferation has not been fully elucidated. METHODS: we used proteomics, gene expression knockdown (KD), quantitative immunofluorescence (qIF), western blots, functional assays including colony-forming assay (CFA) and real-time cell analyzer (RTCA), and in vivo data using immunohistochemistry in breast cancer patients. RESULTS: PD-L1 promoted BC cell proliferation by accelerating cell cycle entry at the G1-to-S phase transition. Global proteomic analysis of the differentially expressed nuclear proteins indicated the involvement of several proliferation-related molecules, including p21(CIP1/WAF1). Western blotting and qIF demonstrated the higher expression of SKP2 and the lower expression of p21(CIP1/WAF1) and p27(Kip1) in PD-L1 expressing (PD-L1(pos)) cells as compared to PD-L1 KD (PD-L1(KD)) cells. Xenograft-derived cells and the TCGA BC dataset confirmed this relationship in vivo. Functionally, CFA and RTCA demonstrated the central role of SKP2 in promoting PD-L1-mediated proliferation. Finally, immunohistochemistry in 74 breast cancer patients confirmed PD-L1 and SKP-p21/p27 axis relationship, as it showed a highly statistically significant correlation between SKP2 and PD-L1 expression (p < 0.001), and both correlated significantly with the proliferation marker Ki-67 (p < 0.001). On the other hand, there was a statistically significant inverse relationship between PD-L1 and p21(CIP1/WAF1) expression (p = 0.005). Importantly, double negativity for p21(CIP1/WAF1) and p27(Kip1) correlated significantly with PD-L1 (p < 0.001), SKP2 (p = 0.002), and Ki-67 (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: we have demonstrated the role of the SKP2-p27/p21 axis in intrinsic PD-L1-enhanced cell cycle progression. Inhibitors of SKP2 expression can alleviate resistance to ICPIs.

    Title: Assessment of the axilla in women with early-stage breast cancer undergoing primary surgery: a review.
    Authors: James J, Law M, Sengupta S, Saunders C
    Abstract: Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is routinely performed in people with node-negative early breast cancer to assess the axilla. SNB has no proven therapeutic benefit. Nodal status information obtained from SNB helps in prognostication and can influence adjuvant systemic and locoregional treatment choices. However, the redundancy of the nodal status information is becoming increasingly apparent. The accuracy of radiological assessment of the axilla, combined with the strong influence of tumour biology on systemic and locoregional therapy requirements, has prompted many to consider alternative options for SNB. SNB contributes significantly to decreased quality of life in early breast cancer patients. Substantial improvements in workflow and cost could accrue by removing SNB from early breast cancer treatment. We review the current viewpoints and ideas for alternative options for assessing and managing a clinically negative axilla in patients with early breast cancer (EBC). Omitting SNB in selected cases or replacing SNB with a non-invasive predictive model appear to be viable options based on current literature.

    Title: Association between pathologic complete response and biochemical indicators after neoadjuvant therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer.
    Authors: Chen W, Zhang J, Li F, Chen Z, Li J, Lu DL
    Abstract: PURPOSE: This study investigated the changes in the fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting triglyceride (FTG), and fasting total cholesterol (FTC) levels during neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer (BC) and the association with pathologic complete response (pCR). METHODS: Relevant data from Sichuan Cancer Hospital from June 2019 to June 2022 were collected and analyzed, and FBG, FTG, and FTC were divided into baseline, change, and process groups, which were grouped to analyze the changes after receiving NAT and the association with pCR. RESULTS: In the estrogen receptor (ER)-negative subgroup, patients with low levels of FTG in the process group were more likely to achieve pCR compared to high levels, and in the progesterone receptor (PR)-negative subgroup, patients with lower FTG compared to higher FTG after receiving NAT was more likely to achieve pCR. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HER2-positive BC undergoing NAT develop varying degrees of abnormalities (elevated or decreased) in FBG, FTG, and FTC; moreover, the status of FTG levels during NAT may predict pCR in ER-negative or PR-negative HER2-positive BC.Early monitoring and timely intervention for FTG abnormalities may enable this subset of patients to increase the likelihood of obtaining a pCR along with management of abnormal markers.

    Title: Radiotherapy-sensitized cancer immunotherapy via cGAS-STING immune pathway by activatable nanocascade reaction.
    Authors: Hu H, Zheng S, He C, Zheng Y, Wei Q, Chen S, Wu Z, Xu Y, Zhao B, Yan C
    Abstract: Radiotherapy-induced immune activation holds great promise for optimizing cancer treatment efficacy. Here, we describe a clinically used radiosensitizer hafnium oxide (HfO(2)) that was core coated with a MnO(2) shell followed by a glucose oxidase (GOx) doping nanoplatform (HfO(2)@MnO(2)@GOx, HMG) to trigger ferroptosis adjuvant effects by glutathione depletion and reactive oxygen species production. This ferroptosis cascade potentiation further sensitized radiotherapy by enhancing DNA damage in 4T1 breast cancer tumor cells. The combination of HMG nanoparticles and radiotherapy effectively activated the damaged DNA and Mn(2+)-mediated cGAS-STING immune pathway in vitro and in vivo. This process had significant inhibitory effects on cancer progression and initiating an anticancer systemic immune response to prevent distant tumor recurrence and achieve long-lasting tumor suppression of both primary and distant tumors. Furthermore, the as-prepared HMG nanoparticles "turned on" spectral computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance dual-modality imaging signals, and demonstrated favorable contrast enhancement capabilities activated by under the GSH tumor microenvironment. This result highlighted the potential of nanoparticles as a theranostic nanoplatform for achieving molecular imaging guided tumor radiotherapy sensitization induced by synergistic immunotherapy.

    Title: The prognostic value of lymph node to primary tumor standardized uptake value ratio in cancer patients: a meta-analysis.
    Authors: Yap WK, Hsu KH, Wang TH, Lin CH, Kang CJ, Huang SM, Lin HC, Hung TM, Chang KP, Tsai TY
    Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The lymph node to primary tumor standardized uptake value ratio (NTR) is an innovative parameter derived from positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scans that captures the intricate relationship between primary tumors and associated lymph nodes. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the prognostic value of NTR in cancer patients. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases was conducted to identify studies investigating the association between NTR and survival outcomes in cancer patients. The pooled adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Twelve studies comprising a total of 2037 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Elevated NTR was significantly associated with worse overall survival aHR (2.21, 95% CI 1.63 to 2.99), disease-free survival aHR (3.27, 95% CI 2.12 to 5.05), and distant metastasis-free survival aHR (2.07, 95% CI 1.55 to 2.78) in cancer patients. Subgroup analyses by cancer type showed consistent results across various malignancies, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, lung cancer, breast cancer, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis provides evidence for a significant association between elevated NTR and worse survival outcomes in cancer patients. Elevated NTR may serve as a useful prognostic biomarker for cancer patients and could potentially be used to guide treatment decisions and monitor disease progression. Future studies should aim to validate these findings in larger and more diverse patient populations and investigate the underlying mechanisms for the observed association between NTR and survival outcomes.

    Title: Longitudinal ultrasound-based AI model predicts axillary lymph node response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer: a multicenter study.
    Authors: Fu Y, Lei YT, Huang YH, Mei F, Wang S, Yan K, Wang YH, Ma YH, Cui LG
    Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Developing a deep learning radiomics model from longitudinal breast ultrasound and sonographer's axillary ultrasound diagnosis for predicting axillary lymph node (ALN) response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer. METHODS: Breast cancer patients undergoing NAC followed by surgery were recruited from three centers between November 2016 and December 2022. We collected ultrasound images for extracting tumor-derived radiomics and deep learning features, selecting quantitative features through various methods. Two machine learning models based on random forest were developed using pre-NAC and post-NAC features. A support vector machine integrated these data into a fusion model, evaluated via the area under the curve (AUC), decision curve analysis, and calibration curves. We compared the fusion model's performance against sonographer's diagnosis from pre-NAC and post-NAC axillary ultrasonography, referencing histological outcomes from sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection. RESULTS: In the validation cohort, the fusion model outperformed both pre-NAC (AUC: 0.899 vs. 0.786, p < 0.001) and post-NAC models (AUC: 0.899 vs. 0.853, p = 0.014), as well as the sonographer's diagnosis of ALN status on pre-NAC and post-NAC axillary ultrasonography (AUC: 0.899 vs. 0.719, p < 0.001). Decision curve analysis revealed patient benefits from the fusion model across threshold probabilities from 0.02 to 0.98. The model also enhanced sonographer's diagnostic ability, increasing accuracy from 71.9% to 79.2%. CONCLUSION: The deep learning radiomics model accurately predicted the ALN response to NAC in breast cancer. Furthermore, the model will assist sonographers to improve their diagnostic ability on ALN status before surgery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Our AI model based on pre- and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy ultrasound can accurately predict axillary lymph node metastasis and assist sonographer's axillary diagnosis. KEY POINTS: Axillary lymph node metastasis status affects the choice of surgical treatment, and currently relies on subjective ultrasound. Our AI model outperformed sonographer's visual diagnosis on axillary ultrasound. Our deep learning radiomics model can improve sonographers' diagnosis and might assist in surgical decision-making.

    Title: A Review on Picrosides Targeting NFkappaB and its Proteins for Treatment of Breast Cancer.
    Authors: Soni D, Anjum Z, Raza K, Verma S
    Abstract: Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed disease causing most deaths in women worldwide. Chemotherapy and neo-adjuvant therapy are the standard method of treatment in early stages of breast cancer. However drug resistance in breast cancer limit the use of these methods for treatment. Research focus is now shifted towards identifying natural phytochemicals with lower toxicity. This review illustrates the NF kappaB interaction with different signaling pathways in normal condition, breast cancer and other cancer and thus represent a potential target for treatment. No reports are available on the action of picrosides on NFkappaB and its associated proteins for anticancer activity. In the present review, potential interaction of picrosides with NF-kappaB and its associated proteins is reviewed for anticancer action. Further, an important facet of this review entails the ADMET analysis of Picroside, elucidating key ADMET properties which serves to underscore the crucial characteristics of Picroside as a potential drug for treating breast cancer. Furthermore, in silico analysis of Picrosides was executed in order to get potential binding modes between ligand (Picrosides II) and NFkappaB.

    Title: Acceptability and Feasibility of Survivorship Group Medical Visits for Breast Cancer Survivors in a Safety Net Hospital.
    Authors: Trejo E, Velazquez AI, Castillo E, Couey P, Cicerelli B, McBride R, Burke NJ, Dixit N
    Abstract: Providing cost-effective, comprehensive survivorship care remains a significant challenge. Breast cancer survivors (BCS) who have limited income and are from marginalized racial and ethnic groups experience a worse quality of life and report higher distress. Thus, innovative care models are required to address the needs of BCS in low resource settings. Group medical visits (GMV), utilized in chronic disease management, are an excellent model for education and building skills. This single-arm intervention study was conducted at a public hospital in California. GMVs consisted of five 2-h weekly sessions focused on survivorship care planning, side effects of treatment and prevention, emotional health, sexual health, physical activity, and diet. The patient navigators recruited three consecutive GMV groups of six English-speaking BCS (N = 17). A multidisciplinary team delivered GMVs, and a patient navigator facilitated all the sessions. We used attendance rates, pre- and post-surveys, and debriefing interviews to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. We enrolled 18 BCS. One participant dropped out before the intervention started, 17 BCS consistently attended and actively participated in the GMV, and 76% (13) attended all planned sessions. Participants rated GMVs in the post-survey and shared their support for GMVs in debriefing interviews. The BCS who completed the post-survey reported that GMVs increased their awareness, confidence, and knowledge of survivorship care. GMVs were explicitly designed to address unmet needs for services necessary for survivorship care but not readily available in safety net settings. Our pilot data suggest that patient-navigator-facilitated GMVs are a feasible and acceptable model for integrating survivorship care in public hospitals.

    Abstract: While some clinics have adopted abbreviated neoadjuvant treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer, there remains a shortage of comprehensive clinical data to support this practice. This is a retrospective, multicenter study. A total of 142 patients were included in the study who are HER2-positive breast cancer, aged </= 65 years, with left ventricular ejection fraction >/= 50%, received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and underwent surgery at 10 different oncology centers in Turkiye between October 2016 and December 2022. The treatment arms were divided into 4-6 cycles of docetaxel/trastuzumab/pertuzumab for arm A, 4 cycles of adriamycin/cyclophosphamide followed by 4 cycles of taxane/TP for arm B. There were 50 patients (35.2%) in arm A and 92 patients (64.8%) in arm B. The median follow-up of all of the patients was 19.9 months (95% CI 17.5-22.3). The 3-year DFS rates for treatment arms A and B were 90.0% and 83.8%, respectively, and the survival outcomes between the groups were similar (p = 0.34). Furthermore, the pathologic complete response rates were similar in both treatment arms, at 50.0% and 51.1%, respectively (p = 0.90). This study supports shortened neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer, a common practice in some clinics.

    Title: Emergence of Quantum Dots as Innovative Tools for Early Diagnosis and Advanced Treatment of Breast Cancer.
    Authors: Diaz-Garcia D, Diaz-Sanchez M, Alvarez-Conde J, Gomez-Ruiz S
    Abstract: Quantum dots (QDs) semiconducting nanomaterials, have garnered attention due to their distinctive properties, including small size, high luminescence, and biocompatibility. In the context of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), notorious for its resistance to conventional treatments, QDs exhibit promising potential for enhancing diagnostic imaging and providing targeted therapies. This review underscores recent advancements in the utilization of QDs in imaging techniques, such as fluorescence tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, aiming at the early and precise detection of tumors. Emphasis is placed on the significance of QD design, synthesis and functionalization processes as well as their use in innovative strategies for targeted drug delivery, capitalizing on their ability to selectively deliver therapeutic agents to cancer cells. As the research in this field advances rapidly, this review covers a classification of QDs according to their composition, the characterization techniques than can be used to determine their properties and, subsequently, emphasizes recent findings in the field of TNBC-targeting, highlighting the imperative need to address challenges, like potential toxicity or methodologies standardization. Collectively, the findings explored thus far suggest that QDs could pave the way for early diagnosis and effective therapy of TNBC, representing a significant stride toward precise and personalized strategies in treating TNBC.

    Title: Effectiveness and safety of neoadjuvant therapy in triple-negative breast cancer in a real-world population.
    Authors: Galindo Garcia C, Diaz Acedo R, Artacho Criado S, Rodriguez de la Borbolla Artacho M
    Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Triple-negative breast cancer is a subtype of aggressive breast cancer. Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of neoadjuvant treatment in early-stage triple-negative breast cancer and to identify predictors of pathological complete response. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective study involving 79 patients with triple-negative breast cancer who initiated neoadjuvant treatment between January 2017 and October 2022. Descriptive analyses were performed as appropriate. Statistical analysis utilized bivariate logistic regression to explore the presence of factors related to pathological complete response, and the Kaplan-Meier method was employed for survival analysis. RESULTS: In the overall population, 27 patients (n=78; 34.6%) achieved pathological complete response in the breast and axillary lymph nodes, and 31 (n=73; 42.5%) achieved a grade 5 pathological complete response in the breast, according to the Miller and Payne classification. The addition of platinum to standard therapy improved both breast and axillary lymph node pathological complete response rates. Age less than 40â€¯years was identified as a predictor of pathological complete response in our study population through bivariate analysis, while Ki67 levels lower than 70% were associated with a lower pathological complete response rate. Adverse events were reported in 72 patients (91.1%), with grade 3-5 adverse events observed in 33 (41.8%). There was a particularly notable increase in gastrointestinal and hematological adverse events when platinum was added. CONCLUSIONS: In this population, we observed moderate rates of pathological complete response with acceptable chemotherapy tolerance. Platinum-based chemotherapy appears to enhance the likelihood of achieving pathological complete response, albeit with a less favorable safety profile. Therefore, evaluating the benefit-risk balance is crucial when selecting the optimal chemotherapy regimen for individual patients.

    Title: Seed distribution stability in permanent breast seed implant brachytherapy.
    Authors: Zhang C, Northway C, Crook J, Hilts M, Batchelar D
    Abstract: PURPOSES: In this study we aim to quantitatively evaluate the stability of implanted seeds in permanent breast seed implant (PBSI) brachytherapy and assess any impact on treatment quality. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty-seven consecutive patients who received PBSI treatment at BC Cancer Kelowna from 2013 to 2021 with post-implant CT images available were included in this study. For each patient, two sets of post-implant CT scans were retrospectively analyzed: Day0, obtained immediately after implant, and Day30, obtained approximately one month following implant. Seed distributions were quantified using the 90% isodose contour, outlier seed maximum spread, and number of seeds located in the seroma as well as seroma quadrants. These were then compared between Day0 and Day30. Post-implant dosimetry of target volumes as well as critical structures were compared. RESULTS: The 90% isodose volume was found to decrease over time. All seeds remained in the breast region however the maximum spread of seeds increased in all directions from Day0 to Day30. All recorded target volume dosimetric parameters were, on average, lower on Day30 compared to Day0 but mean dosimetry levels still met clinical goals. Dose in critical structures was overall similar. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we quantitatively described the changes in seed distributions as well as dosimetry from Day0 to Day30 post PBSI procedure. We addressed concerns related to seed stability in breast tissue and provided clinical evidence on dosimetric efficacy of the PBSI technique.

    Title: Breast cancer risk assessment for prescription of Menopausal Hormone Therapy in women who have a family history of breast cancer.
    Authors: Huntley C, Torr B, Kavanaugh G, George A, Hanson H, Snape K, Broggio J, Glasgow L, Tischkowitz M, Evans DG, Antoniou AC, Turnbull C
    Abstract: Background Menopausal Hormone Therapy (MHT) can alleviate menopausal symptoms but is associated with increased risk of breast cancer (BC). MHT prescription should be preceded by individualised risk/benefit evaluation; however, data outlining the impact of family history alongside different MHT therapeutic approaches are lacking. Aim To quantify the risks associated with MHT use in women with varying BC family histories of i) developing and ii) dying from BC. Design and setting An epidemiological modelling study (UK women). Method We used i) background risks of BC by age and family history, ii) relative risks for BC associated with MHT use, and iii) 10-year BC-specific net mortality rates to model the risk of developing and dying from BC between the ages of 50 and 80 in women with four different BC family history profiles: 'average', 'modest', 'intermediate', and 'strong'. Results For a woman of 'average' family history taking no MHT, the cumulative BC risk (age 50-80) is 9.8%, and the risk of dying from the BC is 1.7%. Five years' exposure to combined-cyclical MHT (age 50-55) increases these risks to 11.0% and 1.8%, respectively. For a woman with a 'strong' family history taking no MHT, the cumulative BC risk is 19.6%, and the risk of dying is 3.2%. With 5 years of MHT (age 50-55), this increases to 22.4% and 3.5%. Conclusion Both family history and MHT are associated with increased risk of BC. Estimates of the risks associated with MHT for women with different family histories can support decision-making around MHT prescription.

    Title: Circadian tumor infiltration and function of CD8(+) T cells dictate immunotherapy efficacy.

    Abstract: The quality and quantity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, particularly CD8(+) T cells, are important parameters for the control of tumor growth and response to immunotherapy. Here, we show in murine and human cancers that these parameters exhibit circadian oscillations, driven by both the endogenous circadian clock of leukocytes and rhythmic leukocyte infiltration, which depends on the circadian clock of endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment. To harness these rhythms therapeutically, we demonstrate that efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy and immune checkpoint blockade can be improved by adjusting the time of treatment during the day. Furthermore, time-of-day-dependent T cell signatures in murine tumor models predict overall survival in patients with melanoma and correlate with response to anti-PD-1 therapy. Our data demonstrate the functional significance of circadian dynamics in the tumor microenvironment and suggest the importance of leveraging these features for improving future clinical trial design and patient care.

    Title: Development of a reliable cell-based reporter gene assay to measure the bioactivity of anti-HER2 therapeutic antibodies.
    Authors: Zhao X, Qian W, Hou S, Wu Y, Guo H, Xu J, Zhang D, Li J, Fu R, Xu M, Wang F
    Abstract: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a key player in the pathogenesis and progression of breast cancer and is currently a primary target for breast cancer immunotherapy. Bioactivity determination is necessary to guarantee the safety and efficacy of therapeutic antibodies targeting HER2. Nevertheless, currently available bioassays for measuring the bioactivity of anti-HER2 mAbs are either not representative or have high variability. Here, we established a reliable reporter gene assay (RGA) based on T47D-SRE-Luc cell line that expresses endogenous HER2 and luciferase controlled by serum response element (SRE) to measure the bioactivity of anti-HER2 antibodies. Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) can lead to the heterodimerization of HER2 on the cell membrane and induce the expression of downstream SRE-controlled luciferase, while pertuzumab can dose-dependently reverse the reaction, resulting in a good dose-response curve reflecting the activity of the antibody. After optimizing the relevant assay parameters, the established RGA was fully validated based on ICH-Q2 (R1), which demonstrated that the method had excellent specificity, accuracy, precision, linearity, and stability. In summary, this robust and innovative bioactivity determination assay can be applied in the development and screening, release control, biosimilar assessment and stability studies of anti-HER2 mAbs.

    Title: The procoagulant signature of cancer cells drives fibrin network formation in tumor microenvironment and impacts its quality. Implications in cancer cell migration and the resistance to anticancer agents.
    Authors: Tran HCM, Mbemba E, Mourot N, Faltas B, Rousseau A, Lefkou E, Sabbah M, van Dreden P, Gerotziafas G
    Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Cancer cells induce hypercoagulability in the tumoral microenvironment by expressing Tissue Factor (TF). We aimed to study the impact of the procoagulant signature of cancer cells on the quality and structure of fibrin network. We also studied the impact of fibrin clot shield (FCS) on the efficiency of anticancer agents and the migration of cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pancreatic cancer cells BXPC3 and breast cancer cells MDA-MB231 and MCF7, were cultured in the presence of normal Platelet Poor Plasma (PPP), diluted 10 % in conditioning media. Their potential to induce thrombin generation and their fibrinolytic activity were assessed. The structure of fibrin network was analyzed with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Cancer cells' mobility with fibrin clot and their interactions with fibrin were observed. Cancer cells were treated with paclitaxel (PTX) or 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4OHTam) in the presence or absence of FCS. RESULTS: Cancer cells, in presence of PPP, induced fibrin network formation. High TF-expressing cancer cells (BXPC3 and MDA-MB23 cells), led to dense fibrin network with fine fibers. Low TF expressing cells MCF7 led to thick fibers. Exogenous TF enhanced the density of fibrin network formed by MCF7 cells. Cancer cells through their inherent profibrinolytic potential migrated within the fiber scaffold. The BXPC3 and MCF7 cells moved in clusters whereas the MDA-MB231 cells moved individually within the fibrin network. FCS decreased the efficiency of PTX and 4OHTam on the viability of cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: The procoagulant signature of cancer cells is determinant for the quality and structure of fibrin network in the microenvironment. Original SEM images show the architecture of "bird's nest"-like fibrin network being in touch with the cell membranes and surrounding cancer cells. Fibrin network constructed by triggering thrombin generation by cancer cells, provides a scaffold for cell migration. Fibrin clot shields protect cancer cells against PTX and 4OHTam.

    Title: Breast imaging in focus: A bibliometric overview of visual quality, modality innovations, and diagnostic performance.
    Authors: Abdulwahid Mohammad Noor K, Mohd Norsuddin N, Che Isa IN, Abdul Karim MK
    Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Breast imaging plays a crucial role in the early detection and management of breast cancer, with visual quality, modality innovation and diagnostic performance being key factors in achieving accurate diagnoses and optimal patient outcomes. This paper presents a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of the literature on the three above elements focusing on breast imaging, aiming to uncover publication trends, identify influential works and authors, and highlight future research directions. METHODS: We employed a methodical bibliometric approach, making use of Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases for gathering literatures. We planned our search strategy, concentrating on terms linked to "breast imaging," "image quality," and "diagnostic accuracy" to ensure a systematic examination of the subject. The enhanced search functions in these databases enabled us to narrow down and improve our findings, choosing only the articles, conference papers, and book sections that are most relevant. After conducting a thorough screening process to remove duplicates and evaluate significance, we utilized ScientoPy and VOSviewer software for an in-depth bibliometric analysis.

    Title: Deep learning-assisted monitoring of trastuzumab efficacy in HER2-Overexpressing breast cancer via SERS immunoassays of tumor-derived urinary exosomal biomarkers.
    Authors: Kim J, Son HY, Lee S, Rho HW, Kim R, Jeong H, Park C, Mun B, Moon Y, Jeong E, Lim EK, Haam S
    Abstract: Monitoring drug efficacy is significant in the current concept of companion diagnostics in metastatic breast cancer. Trastuzumab, a drug targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), is an effective treatment for metastatic breast cancer. However, some patients develop resistance to this therapy; therefore, monitoring its efficacy is essential. Here, we describe a deep learning-assisted monitoring of trastuzumab efficacy based on a surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) immunoassay against HER2-overexpressing mouse urinary exosomes. Individual Raman reporters bearing the desired SERS tag and exosome capture substrate were prepared for the SERS immunoassay; SERS tag signals were collected to prepare deep learning training data. Using this deep learning algorithm, various complicated mixtures of SERS tags were successfully quantified and classified. Exosomal antigen levels of five types of cell-derived exosomes were determined using SERS-deep learning analysis and compared with those obtained via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. Finally, drug efficacy was monitored via SERS-deep learning analysis using urinary exosomes from trastuzumab-treated mice. Use of this monitoring system should allow proactive responses to any treatment-resistant issues.

    Title: Differing Content and Language Based on Poster-Patient Relationships on the Chinese Social Media Platform Weibo: Text Classification, Sentiment Analysis, and Topic Modeling of Posts on Breast Cancer.
    Authors: Zhang Z, Liew K, Kuijer R, She WJ, Yada S, Wakamiya S, Aramaki E
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Breast cancer affects the lives of not only those diagnosed but also the people around them. Many of those affected share their experiences on social media. However, these narratives may differ according to who the poster is and what their relationship with the patient is; a patient posting about their experiences may post different content from someone whose friends or family has breast cancer. Weibo is 1 of the most popular social media platforms in China, and breast cancer-related posts are frequently found there. OBJECTIVE: With the goal of understanding the different experiences of those affected by breast cancer in China, we aimed to explore how content and language used in relevant posts differ according to who the poster is and what their relationship with the patient is and whether there are differences in emotional expression and topic content if the patient is the poster themselves or a friend, family member, relative, or acquaintance. METHODS: We used Weibo as a resource to examine how posts differ according to the different poster-patient relationships. We collected a total of 10,322 relevant Weibo posts. Using a 2-step analysis method, we fine-tuned 2 Chinese Robustly Optimized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) Pretraining Approach models on this data set with annotated poster-patient relationships. These models were lined in sequence, first a binary classifier (no_patient or patient) and then a multiclass classifier (post_user, family_members, friends_relatives, acquaintances, heard_relation), to classify poster-patient relationships. Next, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count lexicon to conduct sentiment analysis from 5 emotion categories (positive and negative emotions, anger, sadness, and anxiety), followed by topic modeling (BERTopic). RESULTS: Our binary model (F(1)-score=0.92) and multiclass model (F(1)-score=0.83) were largely able to classify poster-patient relationships accurately. Subsequent sentiment analysis showed significant differences in emotion categories across all poster-patient relationships. Notably, negative emotions and anger were higher for the "no_patient" class, but sadness and anxiety were higher for the "family_members" class. Focusing on the top 30 topics, we also noted that topics on fears and anger toward cancer were higher in the "no_patient" class, but topics on cancer treatment were higher in the "family_members" class. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese users post different types of content, depending on the poster- poster-patient relationships. If the patient is family, posts are sadder and more anxious but also contain more content on treatments. However, if no patient is detected, posts show higher levels of anger. We think that these may stem from rants from posters, which may help with emotion regulation and gathering social support.

    Authors: Retamales J, Daneri-Navarro A, Artagaveytia N, Alves da Quinta D, Abdelhay E, Podhajcer OL, Velazquez C, Giunta D, Crocamo S, Garibay-Escobar A, Del Toro-Arreola A, Rodriguez R, Aghazarian M, Alcoba E, Alonso I, Binato R, Bravo AI, Canton-Romero J, Carraro DM, Castro M, Castro-Cervantes J, Cataldi S, Camejo N, Cortes-Sanabria L, Flores-Marquez M, Lavina G, Musetti E, Caserta B, Cerda M, Colombo A, Delgadillo-Cristerna R, Dreyer Breitenbach M, Fernandez E, Fernandez J, Franco-Topete R, Gabay C, Gaete F, Gamboa J, Garcia-Gaeta R, Gomez Del Toro M, Gonzalez-Ramirez LP, Guerrero M, Herrera-Miramontes M, Lopez-Vasquez A, Maldonado S, Moran-Mendoza A, Morgan-Villela G, Nagai MA, Navarro-Ruiz N, Oceguera-Villanueva A, Ortiz MA, Quintero J, Quintero-Ramos A, Ramirez-Rosales G, Ramos-Ramirez M, Chiquitelli Marques MM, Rivera Claisse E, Rodriguez-Gonzalez D, Romero-Gomez A, Rosales C, Salas-Gonzalez E, Sanchotena V, Segovia L, Silva-Garcia AA, Valenzuela-Antelo O, Venegas-Godinez L, Zagame L, Gomez J, Llera AS, Muller B
    Abstract: PURPOSE: Breast cancer mortality rates in Latin America (LA) are higher than those in the United States, possibly because of advanced disease presentation, health care disparities, or unfavorable molecular subtypes. The Latin American Cancer Research Network was established to address these challenges and to promote collaborative clinical research. The Molecular Profiling of Breast Cancer Study (MPBCS) aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of LA participants with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The MPBCS enrolled 1,449 participants from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Uruguay. Through harmonized procedures and quality assurance measures, this study evaluated clinicopathologic characteristics, neoadjuvant chemotherapy response, and survival outcomes according to residual cancer burden (RCB) and the type of surgery. RESULTS: Overall, 711 and 480 participants in the primary surgery and neoadjuvant arms, respectively, completed the 5-year follow-up period. Overall survival was independently associated with RCB (worse survival for RCBIII-adjusted hazard ratio, 8.19, P < .001, and RCBII [adjusted hazard ratio, 3.69, P < .008] compared with RCB0 [pathologic complete response or pCR]) and type of surgery (worse survival in mastectomy than in breast-conserving surgery [BCS], adjusted hazard ratio, 2.97, P = .001). The hormone receptor-negative-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive group had the highest proportion of pCR (48.9%). The analysis of the ASCO Quality Oncology Practice Initiative breast module revealed high compliance with pathologic standards but lower adherence to treatment administration standards. Notably, compliance with trastuzumab administration varied widely among countries (33.3%-88.7%). CONCLUSION: In LABC, we demonstrated the survival benefit of BCS and the prognostic effect of the response to available neoadjuvant treatments despite an important variability in access to key treatments. The MPBCS represents a significant step forward in understanding the real-world implementation of oncologic procedures in LA.

    Title: Cognitive impairment following breast cancer treatments: an umbrella review.
    Authors: Oliva G, Giustiniani A, Danesin L, Burgio F, Arcara G, Conte P
    Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) refers to a cognitive decline associated with cancer or its treatments. While research into CRCI is expanding, evidence remains scattered due to differences in study designs, methodologies, and definitions. The present umbrella review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current evidence regarding the impact of different breast cancer therapies on cognitive functioning, with a particular focus on the interplay among objective cognitive deficits (ie, measured with standardized tests), subjective cognitive concerns, (ie, self-reported), and other mediating psycho-physical factors. METHODS: The search was made in Pubmed, Embase, and Scopus for articles published until July 2023, following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis protocol. RESULTS: Chemotherapy and endocrine therapy appear consistently associated with CRCI in patients with breast cancer, primarily affecting memory, attention/concentration, executive functioning, and processing speed. Subjective cognitive concerns were often found weakly or not associated with neuropsychological test results, while overall CRCI seemed consistently associated with psychological distress, fatigue, sleep quality, and inflammatory and biological factors. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that CRCI is common after chemotherapy and endocrine therapy for breast cancer. However, heterogeneity in study designs and the scarcity of studies on more recent treatments such as targeted therapies and immunotherapies, highlight the need for more systematic and harmonized studies, possibly taking into account the complex and multifactorial etiology of CRCI. This may provide valuable insights into CRCI's underlying mechanisms and potential new ways to treat it.

    Title: In silico identification of a novel Cdc2-like kinase 2 (CLK2) inhibitor in triple negative breast cancer.
    Authors: Huang CC, Hsu CM, Chao MW, Hsu KC, Lin TE, Yen SC, Tu HJ, Pan SL
    Abstract: Dysregulation of RNA splicing processes is intricately linked to tumorigenesis in various cancers, especially breast cancer. Cdc2-like kinase 2 (CLK2), an oncogenic RNA-splicing kinase pivotal in breast cancer, plays a significant role, particularly in the context of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a subtype marked by substantial medical challenges due to its low survival rates. In this study, we employed a structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) method to identify potential CLK2 inhibitors with novel chemical structures for treating TNBC. Compound 670551 emerged as a novel CLK2 inhibitor with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) value of 619.7 nM. Importantly, Compound 670551 exhibited high selectivity for CLK2 over other protein kinases. Functionally, this compound significantly reduced the survival and proliferation of TNBC cells. Results from a cell-based assay demonstrated that this inhibitor led to a decrease in RNA splicing proteins, such as SRSF4 and SRSF6, resulting in cell apoptosis. In summary, we identified a novel CLK2 inhibitor as a promising potential treatment for TNBC therapy.

    Title: Declination of Treatment, Racial and Ethnic Disparity, and Overall Survival in US Patients With Breast Cancer.
    Authors: Freeman JQ, Li JL, Fisher SG, Yao KA, David SP, Huo D
    Abstract: IMPORTANCE: Declining treatment negatively affects health outcomes among patients with cancer. Limited research has investigated national trends of and factors associated with treatment declination or its association with overall survival (OS) among patients with breast cancer. OBJECTIVES: To examine trends and racial and ethnic disparities in treatment declination and racial and ethnic OS differences stratified by treatment decision in US patients with breast cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cross-sectional study used data for patients with breast cancer from the 2004 to 2020 National Cancer Database. Four treatment modalities were assessed: chemotherapy, hormone therapy (HT), radiotherapy, and surgery. The chemotherapy cohort included patients with stage I to IV disease. The HT cohort included patients with stage I to IV hormone receptor-positive disease. The radiotherapy and surgery cohorts included patients with stage I to III disease. Data were analyzed from March to November 2023. EXPOSURE: Race and ethnicity and other sociodemographic and clinicopathologic characteristics. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Treatment decision, categorized as received or declined, was modeled using logistic regression. OS was modeled using Cox regression. Models were controlled for year of initial diagnosis, age, sex, health insurance, median household income, facility type, Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score, histology, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, molecular subtype, and tumor grade. RESULTS: The study included 2â€¯837â€¯446 patients (mean [SD] age, 61.6 [13.4] years; 99.1% female), with 1.7% American Indian, Alaska Native, or other patients; 3.5% Asian or Pacific Islander patients; 11.2% Black patients; 5.6% Hispanic patients; and 78.0% White patients. Of 1â€¯296â€¯488 patients who were offered chemotherapy, 124â€¯721 (9.6%) declined; 99â€¯276 of 1â€¯635â€¯916 patients (6.1%) declined radiotherapy; 94â€¯363 of 1â€¯893â€¯339 patients (5.0%) declined HT; and 15â€¯846 of 2â€¯590â€¯963 patients (0.6%) declined surgery. Compared with White patients, American Indian, Alaska Native, or other patients (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.47; 95% CI, 1.26-1.72), Asian or Pacific Islander patients (AOR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.15-1.44), and Black patients (AOR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.89-2.14) were more likely to decline surgery; American Indian, Alaska Native, or other patients (AOR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.05-1.21) and Asian or Pacific Islander patients (AOR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.16-1.27) were more likely to decline chemotherapy; and Black patients were more likely to decline radiotherapy (AOR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.08). Asian or Pacific Islander patients (AOR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.77-0.85), Black patients (AOR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.83-0.89), and Hispanic patients (AOR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.63-0.69) were less likely to decline HT. Furthermore, Black patients who declined chemotherapy had a higher mortality risk than White patients (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02-1.13), while there were no OS differences between Black and White patients who declined HT (AHR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.97-1.13) or radiotherapy (AHR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92-1.04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cross-sectional study highlights racial and ethnic disparities in treatment declination and OS, suggesting the need for equity-focused interventions, such as patient education on treatment benefits and improved patient-clinician communication and shared decision-making, to reduce disparities and improve patient survival.
