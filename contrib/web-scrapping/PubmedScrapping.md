    Title: A dosiomics model for prediction of radiation-induced acute skin toxicity in breast cancer patients: machine learning-based study for a closed bore linac.
    Authors: Saadatmand P, Mahdavi SR, Nikoofar A, Jazaeri SZ, Ramandi FL, Esmaili G, Vejdani S
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Radiation induced acute skin toxicity (AST) is considered as a common side effect of breast radiation therapy. The goal of this study was to design dosiomics-based machine learning (ML) models for prediction of AST, to enable creating optimized treatment plans for high-risk individuals. METHODS: Dosiomics features extracted using Pyradiomics tool (v3.0.1), along with treatment plan-derived dose volume histograms (DVHs), and patient-specific treatment-related (PTR) data of breast cancer patients were used for modeling. Clinical scoring was done using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V4.0 criteria for skin-specific symptoms. The 52 breast cancer patients were grouped into AST 2 + (CTCAE >/= 2) and AST 2 - (CTCAE < 2) toxicity grades to facilitate AST modeling. They were randomly divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) cohorts. Multiple prediction models were assessed through multivariate analysis, incorporating different combinations of feature groups (dosiomics, DVH, and PTR) individually and collectively. In total, seven unique combinations, along with seven classification algorithms, were considered after feature selection. The performance of each model was evaluated on the test group using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and f1-score. Accuracy, precision, and recall of each model were also studied. Statistical analysis involved features differences between AST 2 - and AST 2 + groups and cutoff value calculations. RESULTS: Results showed that 44% of the patients developed AST 2 + after Tomotherapy. The dosiomics (DOS) model, developed using dosiomics features, exhibited a noteworthy improvement in AUC (up to 0.78), when spatial information is preserved in the dose distribution, compared to DVH features (up to 0.71). Furthermore, a baseline ML model created using only PTR features for comparison with DOS models showed the significance of dosiomics in early AST prediction. By employing the Extra Tree (ET) classifiers, the DOS + DVH + PTR model achieved a statistically significant improved performance in terms of AUC (0.83; 95% CI 0.71-0.90), accuracy (0.70), precision (0.74) and sensitivity (0.72) compared to other models. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the benefit of dosiomics-based ML in the prediction of AST. However, the combination of dosiomics, DVH, and PTR yields significant improvement in AST prediction. The results of this study provide the opportunity for timely interventions to prevent the occurrence of radiation induced AST.

    Title: SEEI: spherical evolution with feedback mechanism for identifying epistatic interactions.
    Authors: Tang DY, Mao YJ, Zhao J, Yang J, Li SY, Ren FX, Zheng J
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Detecting epistatic interactions (EIs) involves the exploration of associations among single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and complex diseases, which is an important task in genome-wide association studies. The EI detection problem is dependent on epistasis models and corresponding optimization methods. Although various models and methods have been proposed to detect EIs, identifying EIs efficiently and accurately is still a challenge. RESULTS: Here, we propose a linear mixed statistical epistasis model (LMSE) and a spherical evolution approach with a feedback mechanism (named SEEI). The LMSE model expands the existing single epistasis models such as LR-Score, K2-Score, Mutual information, and Gini index. The SEEI includes an adaptive spherical search strategy and population updating strategy, which ensures that the algorithm is not easily trapped in local optima. We analyzed the performances of 8 random disease models, 12 disease models with marginal effects, 30 disease models without marginal effects, and 10 high-order disease models. The 60 simulated disease models and a real breast cancer dataset were used to evaluate eight algorithms (SEEI, EACO, EpiACO, FDHEIW, MP-HS-DHSI, NHSA-DHSC, SNPHarvester, CSE). Three evaluation criteria (pow1, pow2, pow3), a T-test, and a Friedman test were used to compare the performances of these algorithms. The results show that the SEEI algorithm (order 1, averages ranks = 13.125) outperformed the other algorithms in detecting EIs. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we propose an LMSE model and an evolutionary computing method (SEEI) to solve the optimization problem of the LMSE model. The proposed method performed better than the other seven algorithms tested in its ability to identify EIs in genome-wide association datasets. We identified new SNP-SNP combinations in the real breast cancer dataset and verified the results. Our findings provide new insights for the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.

    Title: A comprehensive overview of metaplastic breast cancer: Features and treatments.
    Authors: Yan Q, Deng Y, Zhang Q
    Abstract: Metaplastic breast cancer is a rare, aggressive, and chemotherapy-resistant subtype of breast cancers, accounting for less than 1% of invasive breast cancers, characterized by adenocarcinoma with spindle cells, squamous epithelium, and/or mesenchymal tissue differentiation. The majority of metaplastic breast cancers exhibit the characteristics of triple-negative breast cancer and have unfavorable prognoses with a lower survival rate. This subtype often displays gene alterations in the PI3K/AKT pathway, Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, and cell cycle dysregulation and demonstrates epithelial-mesenchymal transition, immune response changes, TP53 mutation, EGFR amplification, and so on. Currently, the optimal treatment of metaplastic breast cancer remains uncertain. This article provides a comprehensive review on the clinical features, molecular characteristics, invasion and metastasis patterns, and prognosis of metaplastic breast cancer, as well as recent advancements in treatment strategies.

    Title: Symptomatic adverse events of chemotherapy in breast cancer patients:Using CTCAE, PRO-CTCAE, and EORTC QLQ-C30.
    Authors: Arahori H, Kondo K, Imai Y, Bando T, Inoue H, Sasa S, Takizawa H
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) is used as a tool to evaluate the adverse events (AE) of chemotherapy in cancer patients. Since CTCAE by medical providers underestimates AE more than patient-reported outcomes (PRO), the National Cancer Institute developed PRO-CTCAE. The present study investigated differences between symptoms detected using CTCAE by medical providers and PRO-CTCAE by breast cancer patients. METHODS: Patients received chemotherapy comprising epirubicin and cyclophosphamide pre- or postoperatively. AE were evaluated using 4 questionnaires:PRO-CTCAE, CTCAE, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-30), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) after 1, 2, and 3 courses of chemotherapy. RESULTS: Forty-two patients were registered. Regarding the recognition of psychological symptoms, such as fatigue, anxiety, and discouragement, and subjective symptoms, including heart palpitations and shortness of breath, PRO using PRO-CTCAE was significantly higher than medical provider-recognized outcomes using CTCAE. Concerning the recognition of regimen-specific symptoms, such as vomiting, nausea, and decreased appetite, medical provider- recognized outcomes were the same or higher than PRO. In QLQ-C30, the physical and role functions, fatigue and dyspnea significantly worsened after 2 and 3 courses of chemotherapy. J. Med. Invest. 71 : 82-91, February, 2024.

    Title: Ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast: finding the balance between overtreatment and undertreatment.
    Authors: Delaloge S, Khan SA, Wesseling J, Whelan T
    Abstract: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) accounts for 15-25% of all breast cancer diagnoses. Its prognosis is excellent overall, the main risk being the occurrence of local breast events, as most cases of DCIS do not progress to invasive cancer. Systematic screening has greatly increased the incidence of this non-obligate precursor of invasion, lending urgency to the need to identify DCIS that is prone to invasive progression and distinguish it from non-invasion-prone DCIS, as the latter can be overdiagnosed and therefore overtreated. Treatment strategies, including surgery, radiotherapy, and optional endocrine therapy, decrease the risk of local events, but have no effect on survival outcomes. Active surveillance is being evaluated as a possible new option for low-risk DCIS. Considerable efforts to decipher the biology of DCIS have led to a better understanding of the factors that determine its variable natural history. Given this variability, shared decision making regarding optimal, personalised treatment strategies is the most appropriate course of action. Well designed, risk-based de-escalation studies remain a major need in this field.

    Title: Assessment of safety and tolerability of subcutaneous trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer: Results of an open-label, randomized, multicenter, phase IIIB ESCAPE trial.
    Authors: Kaidarova D, Zhavrid E, Shatkovskaya O, Prokharau A, Akhmed N, Sembayev D, Rutzhanova Z, Ivankov A
    Abstract: AIM: To assess the safety and tolerability of subcutaneous (SC) trastuzumab (Herceptin) administered either with a single-use injection device (SID) or manually from a vial using a hand-held syringe. METHODS: The ESCAPE trial (NCT02194166) included 90 women aged 18 years or older with HER2-positive early breast cancer who underwent surgical treatment and completed (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy (if indicated). Patients enrolled in the study were first subjected to 4 cycles of trastuzumab IV (8 mg/kg loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg maintenance dose, q3w) prior to being randomized into groups: [A] SC trastuzumab (fixed dose 600 mg, q3w) administered through a hand-held syringe followed by 7 cycles of SC trastuzumab administered with an SID or [B] the reverse sequence. RESULTS: Patient-reported outcomes revealed that 78 (94.0 % [95 % CI: 90.4-99.0]) out of 83 patients preferred SC trastuzumab over IV trastuzumab, among whom 28 patients indicated a strong preference. Sixteen out of 17 HCPs (94.1 %) were very satisfied with the use of SC trastuzumab, while 1/17 (5.9 %) remained uncertain. The mean time spent for IV vs. SC trastuzumab administration, including pre- and postinjection procedures, was 93.8 and 22 min, respectively. A total of 49 (54.4 %) patients reported 164 AEs. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, SC trastuzumab was preferred over IV trastuzumab. The duration of SC trastuzumab administration was significantly shorter than that of IV trastuzumab, saving patients and HCPs time. Safety and efficacy results were consistent with other published trials and were not associated with any new safety signal.

    Title: Prognostic significance of HER2 loss after HER2-targeted neoadjuvant treatment in patients with HER2-positive locally advanced breast cancer.
    Authors: Kutlu Y, Cekin R, Aydin SG, Shbair ATM, Bilici A, Arici S, Oven BB, Acikgoz O, Ozcan E, Olmez OF, Cakir A, Seker M
    Abstract: Loss of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression can be seen in almost 25-30 % patients after HER2 receptor directed neoadjuvant treatment. These patients have unclear clinical outcomes in previous studies. We aimed to investigate the importance of HER2 loss, additionally with predictive factors for the loss of HER2. This was a retrospective and multicenter study that included 272 HER2-positive BC patients with no pathological complete response who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus HER2-targeted treatments. The factors that may affect the loss of HER2 detected by immunohistochemistry(IHC) and the association with survival were analyzed.The rate of HER2 loss after neoadjuvant treatments(NAT) was 27.9 % (n = 76). Disease recurrence was observed in 18(23.7 %) patients with HER2 loss, while it was detected in 62 (31.7 %) patients without HER2 loss(p = 0.23). Pre and post-NAT ER status, and post-NAT ki-67 status had a significant impact on disease-free survival(DFS) (p = 0.0012, p = 0.004, and p = 0.04, respectively).There were no significant association between DFS and loss of HER2 (p = 0.64) and dual anti-HER2 blockade (p = 0.21). Pre-NAT clinical stage (HR:1.65 p = 0.013), post-NAT LN status (HR:3.18, p = 0.02) and pre-NAT ER status (HR:0.24, p = 0.041) were significant independent prognostic factors for DFS while post-NAT residual disease in axillar tissue was an independent prognostic factor for OS (HR:1.54 p = 0.019). Moreover, age (<40 years vs >/=40 years) (p = 0.031) and tumor grade (p = 0.004) were predictive factors for HER2 loss. Our results showed that HER2 loss did not affect survivals. However, young age and being high grade tumor may predict HER2 loss.

    Title: Ternary heterostructure-driven photoinduced electron-hole separation enhanced oxidative stress for triple-negative breast cancer therapy.
    Authors: Dong S, Huang Y, Yan H, Tan H, Fan L, Chao M, Ren Y, Guan M, Zhang J, Liu Z, Gao F
    Abstract: Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) stand as among the most significant metal oxide nanoparticles in trigger the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induce apoptosis. Nevertheless, the utilization of ZnO NPs has been limited by the shallowness of short-wavelength light and the constrained production of ROS. To overcome these limitations, a strategy involves achieving a red shift towards the near-infrared (NIR) light spectrum, promoting the separation and restraining the recombination of electron-hole (e(-)-h(+)) pairs. Herein, the hybrid plasmonic system Au@ZnO (AZ) with graphene quantum dots (GQDs) doping (AZG) nano heterostructures is rationally designed for optimal NIR-driven cancer treatment. Significantly, a multifold increase in ROS generation can be achieved through the following creative initiatives: (i) plasmonic Au nanorods expands the photocatalytic capabilities of AZG into the NIR domain, offering a foundation for NIR-induced ROS generation for clinical utilization; (ii) elaborate design of mesoporous core-shell AZ structures facilitates the redistribution of electron-hole pairs; (iii) the incorporation GQDs in mesoporous structure could efficiently restrain the recombination of the e(-)-h(+) pairs; (iv) Modification of hyaluronic acid (HA) can enhance CD44 receptor mediated targeted triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In addition, the introduced Au NRs present as catalysts for enhancing photothermal therapy (PTT), effectively inducing apoptosis in tumor cells. The resulting HA-modified AZG (AZGH) exhibits efficient hot electron injection and e(-)-h(+) separation, affording unparalleled convenience for ROS production and enabling NIR-induced PDT for the cancer treanment. As a result, our well-designed mesoporous core-shell AZGH hybrid as photosensitizers can exhibit excellent PDT efficacy.

    Title: De-escalation of Axillary Surgery After Neoadjuvant Therapy.
    Authors: Connors C, Al-Hilli Z
    Abstract: Surgical de-escalation of the axilla has evolved over the past 28 years since the emergence of sentinel lymph node surgery. Well-documented complications of the once standard of care axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), including lymphedema, led physician scientists towards a progressive push to study and incorporate less invasive techniques in the axilla. Many trials have justified oncologic safety of axillary de-escalation in patients who are spared neoadjuvant treatment. The applicability in the neoadjuvant setting, however, is less clear and axillary surgical approaches in this patient population have evolved at a slower pace. This review aims to analyze current data in axillary management for patients undergoing neoadjuvant treatment and to discuss current surgical approaches based on nodal pathologic response.

    Title: Function and mechanism of action of the TRPV1 channel in the development of triple-negative breast cancer.
    Authors: Yan Z, Huang H, Wang Q, Kong Y, Liu X
    Abstract: Transient receptor potential channel subfamily vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a member of the transient receptor potential family of nonselective cationic transmembrane channel proteins that are involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis. It is expressed in various tumor types and has been implicated in the regulation of cancer growth, metastasis, apoptosis, and cancer-related pain. TRPV1 is highly expressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and both its agonists and antagonists may exert anti-cancer effects. In this review, we provide an overview of the effect of TRPV1 on TNBC development and its influence on immunotherapy in an attempt to facilitate the development of future treatment strategies.

    Title: Rapamycin prevents cyclophosphamide-induced ovarian follicular loss and potentially inhibits tumour proliferation in a breast cancer xenograft mouse model.
    Authors: Tanaka Y, Amano T, Nakamura A, Yoshino F, Takebayashi A, Takahashi A, Yamanaka H, Inatomi A, Hanada T, Yoneoka Y, Tsuji S, Murakami T
    Abstract: STUDY QUESTION: To what extent and via what mechanism does the concomitant administration of rapamycin (a follicle activation pathway inhibitor and antitumour agent) and cyclophosphamide (a highly toxic ovarian anticancer agent) prevent cyclophosphamide-induced ovarian reserve loss and inhibit tumour proliferation in a breast cancer xenograft mouse model? SUMMARY ANSWER: Daily concomitant administration of rapamycin and a cyclic regimen of cyclophosphamide, which has sufficient antitumour effects as a single agent, suppressed cyclophosphamide-induced primordial follicle loss by inhibiting primordial follicle activation in a breast cancer xenograft mouse model, suggesting the potential of an additive inhibitory effect against tumour proliferation. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Cyclophosphamide stimulates primordial follicles by activating the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, resulting in the accumulation of primary follicles, most of which undergo apoptosis. Rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, regulates primordial follicle activation and exhibits potential inhibitory effects against breast cancer cell proliferation. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: To assess ovarian follicular apoptosis, 3 weeks after administering breast cancer cells, 8-week-old mice were randomized into three treatment groups: control, cyclophosphamide, and cyclophosphamide + rapamycin (Cy + Rap) (n = 5 or 6 mice/group). Mice were treated with rapamycin or vehicle control for 1 week, followed by a single dose of cyclophosphamide or vehicle control. Subsequently, the ovaries were resected 24 h after cyclophosphamide administration (short-term treatment groups). To evaluate follicle abundance and the mTOR pathway in ovaries, as well as the antitumour effects and impact on the mTOR pathway in tumours, 8-week-old xenograft breast cancer transplanted mice were randomized into three treatment groups: vehicle control, Cy, and Cy + Rap (n = 6 or 7 mice/group). Rapamycin (5 mg/kg) or the vehicle was administered daily for 29 days. Cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) or the vehicle was administered thrice weekly (long-term treatment groups). The tumour diameter was measured weekly. Seven days after the last cyclophosphamide treatment, the ovaries were harvested, fixed, and sectioned (for follicle counting) or frozen (for further analysis). Similarly, the tumours were resected and fixed or frozen. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) was performed to examine ovarian follicular apoptosis in the short-term treatment groups. All subsequent experiments were conducted in the long-term treatment groups. Tumour growth was evaluated using the tumour volume index. The tumour volume index indicates the relative volume, compared to the volume 3 weeks after tumour cell injection (at treatment initiation) set to 100%. Tumour cell proliferation was evaluated by Ki-67 immunostaining. Activation of the mTOR pathway in tumours was assessed using the protein extracts from tumours and analysed by western blotting. Haematoxylin and eosin staining of ovaries was used to perform differential follicle counts for primordial, primary, secondary, antral, and atretic follicles. Activation of the mTOR pathway in ovaries was assessed using protein extracts from whole ovaries and analysed by western blotting. Localization of mTOR pathway activation within ovaries was assessed by performing anti-phospho-S6 kinase (downstream of mTOR pathway) immunohistochemistry. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Ovaries of the short-term treatment groups were resected 24 h after cyclophosphamide administration and subjected to TUNEL staining of apoptotic cells. No TUNEL-positive primordial follicles were detected in the control, Cy, and Cy + Rap groups. Conversely, many granulosa cells of growing follicles were TUNEL positive in the Cy group but negative in the control and Cy + Rap groups. All subsequent experimental results were obtained from the long-term treatment groups. The tumour volume index stabilized at a mean of 160-200% in the Cy group and 130% in the Cy + Rap group throughout the treatment period. In contrast, tumours in the vehicle control group grew continuously with a mean tumour volume index of 600%, significantly greater than that of the two treatment groups. Based on the western blot analysis of tumours, the mTOR pathway was activated in the vehicle control group and downregulated in the Cy + Rap group when compared with the control and Cy groups. Ki-67 immunostaining of tumours showed significant inhibition of cell proliferation in the Cy + Rap group when compared with that in the control and Cy groups. The ovarian follicle count revealed that the Cy group had significantly fewer primordial follicles (P < 0.001) than the control group, whereas the Cy + Rap group had significantly higher number of primordial follicles (P < 0.001, 2.5 times) than the Cy group. The ratio of primary to primordial follicles was twice as high in the Cy group than in the control group; however, no significant difference was observed between the control group and the Cy + Rap group. Western blot analysis of ovaries revealed that the mTOR pathway was activated by cyclophosphamide and inhibited by rapamycin. The phospho-S6 kinase (pS6K)-positive primordial follicle rate was 2.7 times higher in the Cy group than in the control group. However, this effect was suppressed to a level similar to the control group in the Cy + Rap group. LARGE SCALE DATA: None. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The combinatorial treatment of breast cancer tumours with rapamycin and cyclophosphamide elicited inhibitory effects on cell proliferative potential compared to cyclophosphamide monotherapy. However, no statistically significant additive effect was observed on tumour volume. Thus, the beneficial antitumour effect afforded by rapamycin administration on breast cancer could not be definitively proven. Although rapamycin has ovarian-protective effects, it does not fully counteract the ovarian toxicity of cyclophosphamide. Nevertheless, rapamycin is advantageous as an ovarian protective agent as it can be used in combination with other ovarian protective agents, such as hormonal therapy. Hence, in combination with other agents, mTOR inhibitors may be sufficiently ovario-protective against high-dose and cyclic cyclophosphamide regimens. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Compared with a cyclic cyclophosphamide regimen that replicates human clinical practice under breast cancer-bearing conditions, the combination with rapamycin mitigates the ovarian follicle loss of cyclophosphamide without interfering with the anticipated antitumour effects. Hence, rapamycin may represent a new non-invasive treatment option for cyclophosphamide-induced ovarian dysfunction in breast cancer patients.

    Title: Breast Articles From 2023: Informing Practice Across the Continuum of Care.
    Authors: King TA, Mittendorf EA
    Abstract: With new investigations and clinical trials in breast oncology reported every year, it is critical that surgeons be aware of advances and insights into the evolving care paradigms and treatments available to their patients. This article highlights five publications found to be particularly impactful this past year. These articles report on efforts to select the minimal effective dose of tamoxifen for prevention, to challenge the existing age-based screening guidelines as they relate to race and ethnicity, to refine axillary management treatment standards, to optimize systemic therapy in multidisciplinary care settings, and to reduce the burden of breast cancer-related lymphedema after treatment. Taken together, these efforts have an impact on all facets of the continuum of care from prevention and screening through treatment and survivorship.

    Title: UK guidelines for the management of soft tissue sarcomas.
    Authors: Hayes AJ, Nixon IF, Strauss DC, Seddon BM, Desai A, Benson C, Judson IR, Dangoor A
    Abstract: Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are rare tumours arising in mesenchymal tissues and can occur almost anywhere in the body. Their rarity, and the heterogeneity of subtype and location, means that developing evidence-based guidelines is complicated by the limitations of the data available. This makes it more important that STS are managed by expert multidisciplinary teams, to ensure consistent and optimal treatment, recruitment to clinical trials, and the ongoing accumulation of further data and knowledge. The development of appropriate guidance, by an experienced panel referring to the evidence available, is therefore a useful foundation on which to build progress in the field. These guidelines are an update of the previous versions published in 2010 and 2016 [1, 2]. The original guidelines were drawn up by a panel of UK sarcoma specialists convened under the auspices of the British Sarcoma Group (BSG) and were intended to provide a framework for the multidisciplinary care of patients with soft tissue sarcomas. This iteration of the guidance, as well as updating the general multidisciplinary management of soft tissue sarcoma, includes specific sections relating to the management of sarcomas at defined anatomical sites: gynaecological sarcomas, retroperitoneal sarcomas, breast sarcomas, and skin sarcomas. These are generally managed collaboratively by site specific multidisciplinary teams linked to the regional sarcoma specialist team, as stipulated in the recently published sarcoma service specification [3]. In the UK, any patient with a suspected soft tissue sarcoma should be referred to a specialist regional soft tissues sarcoma service, to be managed by a specialist sarcoma multidisciplinary team. Once the diagnosis has been confirmed using appropriate imaging and a tissue biopsy, the main modality of management is usually surgical excision performed by a specialist surgeon, combined with pre- or post-operative radiotherapy for tumours at higher risk for local recurrence. Systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) may be utilised in cases where the histological subtype is considered more sensitive to systemic treatment. Regular follow-up is recommended to assess local control, development of metastatic disease, and any late effects of treatment.

    Title: Transcript and protein signatures derived from shared molecular interactions across cancers are associated with mortality.
    Authors: Zhao Y, Li X, Loscalzo J, Smelik M, Sysoev O, Wang Y, Mahmud AKMF, Mansour Aly D, Benson M
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Characterization of shared cancer mechanisms have been proposed to improve therapy strategies and prognosis. Here, we aimed to identify shared cell-cell interactions (CCIs) within the tumor microenvironment across multiple solid cancers and assess their association with cancer mortality. METHODS: CCIs of each cancer were identified by NicheNet analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data from breast, colon, liver, lung, and ovarian cancers. These CCIs were used to construct a shared multi-cellular tumor model (shared-MCTM) representing common CCIs across cancers. A gene signature was identified from the shared-MCTM and tested on the mRNA and protein level in two large independent cohorts: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, 9185 tumor samples and 727 controls across 22 cancers) and UK biobank (UKBB, 10,384 cancer patients and 5063 controls with proteomics data across 17 cancers). Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association of the signature with 10-year all-cause mortality, including sex-specific analysis. RESULTS: A shared-MCTM was derived from five individual cancers. A shared gene signature was extracted from this shared-MCTM and the most prominent regulatory cell type, matrix cancer-associated fibroblast (mCAF). The signature exhibited significant expression changes in multiple cancers compared to controls at both mRNA and protein levels in two independent cohorts. Importantly, it was significantly associated with mortality in cancer patients in both cohorts. The highest hazard ratios were observed for brain cancer in TCGA (HR [95%CI] = 6.90[4.64-10.25]) and ovarian cancer in UKBB (5.53[2.08-8.80]). Sex-specific analysis revealed distinct risks, with a higher mortality risk associated with the protein signature score in males (2.41[1.97-2.96]) compared to females (1.84[1.44-2.37]). CONCLUSION: We identified a gene signature from a comprehensive shared-MCTM representing common CCIs across different cancers and revealed the regulatory role of mCAF in the tumor microenvironment. The pathogenic relevance of the gene signature was supported by differential expression and association with mortality on both mRNA and protein levels in two independent cohorts.

    Title: Survey of awareness and beliefs about cancer (ABC) in Tehran Province, Iran.
    Authors: Akbari P, Nemati S, Nahvijou A, Bolourinejad P, Forbes L, Zendehdel K
    Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Knowledge, attitudes, and practices are essential measures for planning and evaluating cancer control programs. Little is known about these in Iran. METHODS: We conducted a population-based interview survey of adults aged 30-70 using the Farsi version of the Awareness and Beliefs about Cancer questionnaire in the capital province of Tehran, Iran, 2019. We calculated weighted estimates of levels of cancer knowledge, attitudes, and practices to allow for different selection probabilities and nonresponse. We used multivariate logistic regression to understand demographic factors associated with bowel, cervix, and breast screening practices. RESULTS: We interviewed 736 men and 744 women. The mean number of recalled cancer warning signs was less than one; 57.7% could not recall any cancer warning signs. Participants recognized 5.6 out of 11 early cancer warning signs and 8.8 of 13 cancer risk factors. Most (82.7%) did not know that HPV infection was a cancer risk factor. Approximately, half had negative attitudes towards cancer treatment, but over 80% had positive attitudes towards the effectiveness of screening for improving survival. Colorectal, breast, and cervical screening rates were 24%, 42%, and 49%, respectively. Higher socioeconomic status increased the odds of taking up screening for cancer. Women aged 60-70 were less likely to report taking up breast and cervical screening than younger women. DISCUSSION: The Iranian population has poor awareness and negative attitudes about cancer, and participation in screening programs is low. Public awareness and early detection of cancer should be promoted in Iran.

    Title: Erianin inhibits the progression of triple-negative breast cancer by suppressing SRC-mediated cholesterol metabolism.
    Authors: Li M, Kang S, Deng X, Li H, Zhao Y, Tang W, Sheng M
    Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is highly malignant and lacks effective biotherapeutic targets. The development of efficient anticancer drugs with low toxicity and few side effects is a hotspot in TNBC treatment research. Although erianin is known to have potent antitumor activity, its regulatory mechanism and target in TNBC have not been fully elucidated, hampering further drug development. This study showed that erianin can significantly inhibit TNBC cell proliferation and migration, promote cell apoptosis, and inhibit the growth of transplanted tumors in mice. Mechanistically, through network pharmacology analysis, molecular docking and cellular thermal shift assays, we preliminarily identified SRC as the cellular target of erianin. Erianin potently inhibited the expression of SRC, which mediated the anticancer effect of erianin in TNBC. Moreover, erianin can downregulate the expression of genes related to cholesterol synthesis and uptake by targeting SRC, interfering with cholesterol levels in TNBC, thereby inhibiting the progression of TNBC in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, our results suggest that erianin may inhibit the progression of TNBC by suppressing SRC-mediated cholesterol metabolism, and erianin has the great potential to be an effective treatment for TNBC patients.

    Title: Advanced-stage breast cancer diagnosis and its determinants in Ethiopia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
    Authors: Zewdie A, Kassie TD, Anagaw TF, Mazengia EM, Gelaw SS, Fenta ET, Eshetu HB, Kebede N, Bogale EK
    Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Worldwide, breast cancer is the primary cause of illness and death. Unless early detected and treated breast cancer is a life-threatening tumor. Advanced-stage presentation is greatly linked with short survival time and increased mortality rates. In Ethiopia nationally summarized evidence on the level of advanced-stage breast cancer diagnosis is scarce. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the pooled prevalence of advanced-stage breast cancer diagnosis and its determinants in Ethiopia. METHOD: By following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out. To include relevant publications, a broad literature search was conducted in the African Online Journal, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Embase which are published until last search date; June 15, 2023. To prevent further duplication this review was registered in PROSPERO database with ID no of CRD42023435096. To determine the pooled prevalence, a weighted inverse variance random effect model was applied. I(2) statistics and the Cochrane Q-test were computed to determine heterogeneity. To evaluate publication bias, a funnel plot, and Egger's regression test were used. RESULT: A total of 924 articles were sought and finally 20 articles were included in this review. The pooled prevalence of advanced-stage breast cancer diagnosis in Ethiopia was 72.56% (95%CI; 68.46-76.65%). Use of traditional medicine as first choice (AOR = 1.32, 95% CI: (1.13-1.55)), delay of > 3 months in seeking care (AOR = 1.24, 95% CI: (1.09-1.41)), diagnosis or health system delay of > 2 months (AOR = 1.27, 95% CI: (1.11-1.46)), rural residence (AOR = 2.04, 95% CI: (1.42 - 2.92)), and chief complaint of a painless breast lump (AOR = 2.67, 95% CI: (1.76-4.06)) were significantly associated to advanced-stage diagnosis. CONCLUSION: In Ethiopia, more than two-thirds of breast cancer cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Use of traditional medicine before diagnostic confirmation, delay in seeking care, health system delay, rural residence, and chief complaint of painless breast lump were positively associated with an advanced-stage diagnosis. Policymakers and program designers give great focus to those delays so as to seek and access modern diagnosis and treatment as early as possible specifically focusing on those who are rurally residing.

    Title: Metaplastic breast cancer with a unique presentation and complete response to chemotherapy: a case report.
    Authors: Nahhat F, Doyya M, Zabad K, Ksiri H
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Metaplastic breast carcinomas are a rare variant group of breast carcinomas. They are usually high-grade and triple-negative tumors. They often present with large primary tumor sizes. However, the involvement of axillary lymph nodes is infrequent at the time of diagnosis. Metaplastic breast carcinomas are associated with a worse prognosis and a poorer response to chemotherapy in comparison with other non-metaplastic triple-negative breast cancers. Up until this point, there are no specific treatment recommendations for metaplastic breast carcinomas beyond those intended for invasive breast cancer in general. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old woman complained of a palpable mass in her left axilla. On ultrasonography, the mass was solid, spindle-shaped, hypoechoic with regular borders, and exhibited decreased vascularity. At first, the mass appeared to be of a muscular origin. There was not any clinical nor ultrasonic evidence of a primary breast tumor. On magnetic resonance imaging, the axillary mass was a well-defined with regular borders, measuring 24 x 35 mm. Needle biopsy showed a spindle cell tumor with mild to moderate atypia. The subsequent surgical resection revealed a spindle cell neoplasm within a lymph node, favoring a metastatic origin of the tumor. The tumor cells lacked expression of estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors. PET-CT scan indicated pathological uptake in the left breast. Accordingly, the patient was diagnosed with metaplastic breast cancer that had metastasized to the axillary lymph node. She commenced a combined chemotherapy regimen of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. After six treatment cycles, she underwent left modified radical mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection. Pathological examination of the specimens revealed a total burn-out tumor in the breast due to excellent treatment response. There were no residual tumor cells. All dissected lymph nodes were free of tumor. At the one-year follow-up, the patient showed no signs of tumor recurrence. CONCLUSION: This report sheds light on a distinctive presentation of metaplastic breast carcinoma, emphasizing the need for vigilance in diagnosing this rare and aggressive breast cancer variant. In addition, the patient's remarkable response to chemotherapy highlights potential treatment avenues for metaplastic breast cancer.

    Title: Clinical and Imaging Characteristics of Contrast-enhanced Mammography and MRI to Distinguish Microinvasive Carcinoma from Ductal Carcinoma In situ.
    Authors: Hua B, Yang G, An Y, Lou K, Chen J, Quan G, Yuan T
    Abstract: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The prognosis of ductal carcinoma in situ with microinvasion (DCISM) is more similar to that of small invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) than to pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). It is particularly important to accurately distinguish between DCISM and DCIS. The present study aims to compare the clinical and imaging characteristics of contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) between DCISM and pure DCIS, and to identify predictive factors of microinvasive carcinoma, which may contribute to a comprehensive understanding of DCISM in clinical diagnosis and support surveillance strategies, such as surgery, radiation, and other treatment decisions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-seven female patients diagnosed with DCIS were included in the study from May 2019 to August 2023. Patients were further divided into two groups based on pathological diagnosis: DCIS and DCISM. Clinical and imaging characteristics of these two groups were analyzed statistically. The independent clinical risk factors were selected using multivariate logistic regression and used to establish the logistic model [Logit(P)]. The diagnostic performance of independent predictors was assessed and compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and DeLong's test. RESULTS: In CEM, the maximum cross-sectional area (CSAmax), the percentage signal difference between the enhancing lesion and background in the craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique projection (%RSCC, and %RSMLO) were found to be significantly higher for DCISM compared to DCIS (p = 0.001; p < 0.001; p = 0.008). Additionally, there were noticeable statistical differences in the patterns of enhancement morphological distribution (EMD) and internal enhancement pattern (IEP) between DCIS and DCISM (p = 0.047; p = 0.008). In MRI, only CSAmax (p = 0.012) and IEP (p = 0.020) showed significant statistical differences. The multivariate regression analysis suggested that CSAmax (in CEM or MR) and %RSCC were independent predictors of DCISM (all p < 0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) of CSAmax (CEM), %RSCC (CEM), Logit(P) (CEM), and CSAmax (MR) were 0.764, 0.795, 0.842, and 0.739, respectively. There were no significant differences in DeLong's test for these values (all p > 0.10). DCISM was significantly associated with high nuclear grade, comedo type, high axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis, and high Ki-67 positivity compared to DCIS (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The tumor size (CSAmax), enhancement index (%RS), and internal enhancement pattern (IEP) were highly indicative of DCISM. DCISM tends to express more aggressive pathological features, such as high nuclear grade, comedo-type necrosis, ALN metastasis, and Ki-67 overexpression. As with MRI, CEM has the capability to help predict when DCISM is accompanying DCIS.

    Title: Gastrointestinal Toxicity of Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs) in Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Pooled Analysis.
    Authors: Pedersini R, Buffoni M, Petrelli F, Ghidini A, di Mauro P, Amoroso V, Parati MC, Laini L, Cosentini D, Schivardi G, Ippolito G, Berruti A, Lagana M
    Abstract: Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), sacituzumab govitecan (SG), and trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) are three ADCs approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Since gastrointestinal toxicities have been commonly observed with these drugs in clinical trials, a pooled analysis evaluating gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs) in patients with MBC treated with ADCs in clinical trials was performed. PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception until May 2023 for phase II and III clinical trials reporting frequency and severity of gastrointestinal AEs during treatment with ADCs. Data were retrieved for nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain: overall and grade 3-4 toxicity rates according to NCI-CTCAE were collected and expressed as proportions. A pre-specified subgroup analysis according to the agent was also carried out. Fourteen studies, comprising 5608 patients, were included in the analysis. Gastrointestinal AEs were frequently registered with SG and T-DXd. A significantly higher frequency of nausea (65.6% with SG, 75% with T-DXd), vomiting (43.7% with SG, 45% with T-DXd), and diarrhea (59.7% with SG, 29% with T-DXd) was noticed with these ADCs compared to TDM-1. Furthermore, diarrhea was more frequently associated with SG (grade 3 in 7.5% of patients), while constipation and abdominal pain were less common. Gastrointestinal AEs, notably nausea and diarrhea, were frequently reported by MBC patients treated with SG and T-DXd in clinical trials. Since these ADCs are administered continuously until disease progression or occurrence of unbearable AEs, gastrointestinal toxicity may have a negative impact on patient quality of life. Therefore, appropriate management of gastrointestinal AEs is mandatory to ensure treatment efficacy and adherence.

    Title: Doxorubicin encapsulated blend of sitagliptin-lignin polymeric drug delivery system for effective combination therapy against cancer.
    Authors: Liaqat S, Fatima B, Hussain D, Imran M, Zahra Jawad SE, Imran M, Saeed A, Majeed S, Najam-Ul-Haq M
    Abstract: In this research, a sitagliptin-lignin biopolymer (SL) containing zinc selenide quantum dots (ZnSe QDs) and doxorubicin (doxo) was synthesized. The fabricated polymeric drug delivery system was characterized via FTIR, XRD, SEM, TGA, IR, and DSC. SLQD-Doxo exhibited an irregular surface with a 32 nm diameter and well-defined surface chemistry. Drug loading efficiency was assessed at different concentrations, pH levels, time intervals, and temperatures, and drug kinetics were calculated. Maximum drug release was observed at 6 mumol concentration after 24 h, pH of 6.5 and 45  degrees C. The maximum drug encapsulation efficiency was 81.75 %. SLQD-Doxo demonstrated 24.4 +/- 1.04 % anti-inflammatory activity, and the maximum lipoxygenase inhibition in a concentration-dependent manner was 71.45 +/- 2.02 %, compared to indomethacin, a standard anticancer drug. The designed system was applied to breast cancer MCF-7 cells to evaluate anticancer activity. Cytotoxicity of SLQD-Doxo resulted in 24.48 +/- 1.64 dead cells and 74.39 +/- 4.12 viable cells. Lignin's polyphenolic nature resulted in good antioxidant activity of LLQD-Doxo. The combination of SLQD-Doxo was appropriate for drug delivery at high temperatures and acidic pH of tumor cells compared to healthy cells.

    Title: Preparation, characterization and evaluation of HPbetaCD-PTX/PHB nanoparticles for pH-responsive, cytotoxic and apoptotic properties.
    Authors: Aslam A, Masood F, Perveen K, Berger MR, Pervaiz A, Zepp M, Klika KD, Yasin T, Hameed A
    Abstract: Paclitaxel (PTX) is a potent anticancer drug. However, PTX exhibits extremely poor solubility in aqueous solution along with severe side effects. Therefore, in this study, an inclusion complex was prepared between PTX and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPbetaCD) by solvent evaporation to enhance the drug's solubility. The HPbetaCD-PTX inclusion complex was then encapsulated in poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) to fabricate drug-loaded nanoparticles (HPbetaCD-PTX/PHB NPs) by nanoprecipitation. The HPbetaCD-PTX/PHB NPs depicted a higher release of PTX at pH 5.5 thus demonstrating a pH-dependent release profile. The cytotoxic properties of HPbetaCD-PTX/PHB NPs were tested against MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and SW-620 cell lines. The cytotoxic potential of HPbetaCD-PTX/PHB NPs was 2.59-fold improved in MCF-7 cells in comparison to free PTX. Additionally, the HPbetaCD-PTX/PHB NPs improved the antimitotic (1.68-fold) and apoptotic (8.45-fold) effects of PTX in MCF-7 cells in comparison to PTX alone. In summary, these pH-responsive nanoparticles could be prospective carriers for enhancing the cytotoxic properties of PTX for the treatment of breast cancer.

    Title: A review concerning the breast cancer-related tumour microenvironment.
    Authors: Rodriguez-Bejarano OH, Parra-Lopez C, Patarroyo MA
    Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) is currently the most common malignant tumour in women and one of the leading causes of their death around the world. New and increasingly personalised diagnostic and therapeutic tools have been introduced over the last few decades, along with significant advances regarding the study and knowledge related to BC. The tumour microenvironment (TME) refers to the tumour cell-associated cellular and molecular environment which can influence conditions affecting tumour development and progression. The TME is composed of immune cells, stromal cells, extracellular matrix (ECM) and signalling molecules secreted by these different cell types. Ever deeper understanding of TME composition changes during tumour development and progression will enable new and more innovative therapeutic strategies to become developed for targeting tumours during specific stages of its evolution. This review summarises the role of BC-related TME components and their influence on tumour progression and the development of resistance to therapy.

    Title: Metal organic framework-based polymeric hydrogel: A promising drug delivery vehicle for the treatment of breast cancer.
    Authors: Pandya I, Kumar S, Aswal VK, El Seoud O, Assiri MA, Malek N
    Abstract: The constraints associated with current cancer therapies have inspired scientists to develop advanced, precise, and safe drug delivery methods. These delivery systems boost treatment effectiveness, minimize harm to healthy cells, and combat cancer recurrence. To design advanced drug delivery vehicle with these character, in the present manuscript, we have designed a self-healing and injectable hybrid hydrogel through synergistically interacting metal organic framework, CuBTC with the poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). This hybrid hydrogel acts as a localized drug delivery system and was used to encapsulate and release the anticancer drug 5-Fluorouracil selectively at the targeted site in response to the physiological pH. The hydrogel was formed through transforming the gaussian coil like matrix of PVA-CuBTC into a three-dimensional network of hydrogel upon the addition of crosslinker; borax. The biocompatible character of the hydrogel was confirmed through cell viability test. The biocompatible hybrid hydrogel then was used to encapsulate and studied for the pH responsive release behavior of the anti-cancer drug, 5-FU. The in vitro cytotoxicity of the drug-loaded hydrogel was evaluated against MCF-7 and HeLa cells. The study confirms that the hybrid hydrogel is effective for targeted and sustained release of anticancer drugs at cancer sites.

    Title: Empagliflozin drives ferroptosis in anoikis-resistant cells by activating miR-128-3p dependent pathway and inhibiting CD98hc in breast cancer.
    Authors: Nalla LV, Khairnar A
    Abstract: A tumour suppressor miRNA, miR-128-3p, is widely involved in various biological processes and has been found to get downregulated in breast cancer patients. We previously published that ectopically expressed miR-128-3p suppressed migration, invasion, cell cycle arrest, and breast cancer stem cells. In the present study, we explored the role of Empagliflozin (EMPA) as a miR-128-3p functionality-mimicking drug in inducing ferroptosis by inhibiting CD98hc. Given that CD98hc is one of the proteins critical in triggering ferroptosis, we confirmed that miR-128-3p and EMPA inhibited SP1, leading to inhibition of CD98hc expression. Further, transfection with siCD98hc, miR-128-3p mimics, and inhibitors was performed to assess their involvement in the ferroptosis of anoikis-resistant cells. We proved that anoikis-resistant cells possess high ROS and iron levels. Further, miR-128-3p and EMPA treatments induced ferroptosis by inhibiting GSH and enzymatic activity of GPX4 and also induced lipid peroxidation. Moreover, EMPA suppressed bioluminescence of 4T1-Red-FLuc induced thoracic cavity, peritoneal tumour burden and lung nodules in an in vivo metastatic model of breast cancer. Collectively, we revealed that EMPA sensitized the ECM detached cells to ferroptosis by synergically activating miR-128-3p and lowering the levels of SP1 and CD98hc, making it a potential adjunct drug for breast cancer chemotherapy.

    Title: Literature review on the bilateral occurrence of invasive lobular breast cancer.
    Authors: Verboven G, Lodewijkx I, Van den Bosch L, Huizing M, Van Goethem M, Broeckx G, Tjalma WA
    Abstract: Historically, it has been believed that invasive lobular carcinomas (ILC) occur more frequently bilaterally compared to other invasive subtypes, with estimates ranging between 20% and 29%. This study aims to determine if this historical perspective still holds true. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to examine the bilateral occurrence of lobular carcinoma using various imaging methods. Additionally, the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detecting contralateral carcinomas was also investigated. A comprehensive search was conducted in the MedLine database on the PubMed platform, resulting in 307 articles published between January 1, 2014, and January 1, 2023. Various selection criteria were applied to identify articles relevant to the research question. After careful assessment, eight articles remained that met the eligibility criteria, all of which provided level-three evidence and were therefore included in the literature review. A total of 599 patients were included in this review, comprising a total of 602 cases of ILC. Six out of the eight articles reviewed provided information on the bilateral occurrence of ILC based on histopathology. A weighted average calculation yielded a bilaterality percentage of 4.95% (24 out of 485 cases). Four articles reported the number of bilateral cases identified through MRI, resulting in a weighted average of 10.2% (26 out of 255 cases). It is worth noting that 20.4% (100 out of 491) of the performed MRIs were found to be either useless or even harmful. Furthermore, MRI led to a change in the treatment plan in 27.7% (136 out of 491) of cases. Overall, it can be concluded that there is limited available data regarding the bilateral occurrence of ILC. The numbers found in the literature are also inconsistent and tend to vary. The literature review revealed a decrease in the percentage of bilaterality compared to historical beliefs. Based on this study, it can be concluded that a high number of MRI scans were found to be either useless or harmful. As a result of this conclusion and a higher sensitivity of other screening modalities, MRI may no longer be indicated as part of the standard workup for ILC. However, further research is necessary to validate these findings.

    Title: Cryopreservation of ovarian tissue for fertility preservation in breast cancer patients: time to stop?
    Authors: Macklon KT, De Vos M
    Abstract: Fertility preservation is currently offered to young women with breast cancer to increase their chances of motherhood after a potentially gonadotoxic treatment. Ovarian stimulation with oocyte vitrification and cryopreservation of ovarian tissue remain the most commonly used methods of choice. Whichever method is preferred is very much dependent on the practice and experience of the clinics, although for breast cancer in particular one method might be superior to the other. Cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is inevitably associated with the iatrogenic reduction of the ovarian reserve of a patient and should only be offered to women with a high risk of premature ovarian insufficiency following treatment. However, for younger breast cancer survivors, pregnancy and delivery rates are reassuringly high, even after chemotherapy. Despite its widespread use, few women come back to make use of their cryopreserved tissue. It is argued here that cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is not an appropriate option for breast cancer patients and discuss the reasons for this opinion.

    Title: Cholesteryl ester transfer protein knock-down in conjunction with a cholesterol-depleting agent decreases tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells.
    Authors: Gu L, Pillay RP, Aronson R, Kaur M
    Abstract: The cholesterogenic phenotype, encompassing de novo biosynthesis and accumulation of cholesterol, aids cancer cell proliferation and survival. Previously, the role of cholesteryl ester (CE) transfer protein (CETP) has been implicated in breast cancer aggressiveness, but the molecular basis of this observation is not clearly understood, which this study aims to elucidate. CETP knock-down resulted in a >50% decrease in cell proliferation in both 'estrogen receptor-positive' (ER+; Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF7) breast cancer cells) and 'triple-negative' breast cancer (TNBC; MDA-MB-231) cell lines. Intriguingly, the abrogation of CETP together with the combination treatment of tamoxifen (5 muM) and acetyl plumbagin (a cholesterol-depleting agent) (5 muM) resulted in twofold to threefold increase in apoptosis in both cell lines. CETP knockdown also showed decreased intracellular CE levels, lipid raft and lipid droplets in both cell lines. In addition, RT(2) Profiler PCR array (Qiagen, Germany)-based gene expression analysis revealed an overall downregulation of genes associated in cholesterol biosynthesis, lipid signalling and drug resistance in MCF7 cells post-CETP knock-down. On the contrary, resistance in MDA-MB-231 cells was reduced through increased expression in cholesterol efflux genes and the expression of targetable surface receptors by endocrine therapy. The pilot xenograft mice study substantiated CETP's role as a cancer survival gene as knock-down of CETP stunted the growth of TNBC tumour by 86%. The principal findings of this study potentiate CETP as a driver in breast cancer growth and aggressiveness and thus targeting CETP could limit drug resistance via the reduction in cholesterol accumulation in breast cancer cells, thereby reducing cancer aggressiveness.

    Title: GEnDDn: An lncRNA-Disease Association Identification Framework Based on Dual-Net Neural Architecture and Deep Neural Network.
    Authors: Peng L, Ren M, Huang L, Chen M
    Abstract: Accumulating studies have demonstrated close relationships between long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and diseases. Identification of new lncRNA-disease associations (LDAs) enables us to better understand disease mechanisms and further provides promising insights into cancer targeted therapy and anti-cancer drug design. Here, we present an LDA prediction framework called GEnDDn based on deep learning. GEnDDn mainly comprises two steps: First, features of both lncRNAs and diseases are extracted by combining similarity computation, non-negative matrix factorization, and graph attention auto-encoder, respectively. And each lncRNA-disease pair (LDP) is depicted as a vector based on concatenation operation on the extracted features. Subsequently, unknown LDPs are classified by aggregating dual-net neural architecture and deep neural network. Using six different evaluation metrics, we found that GEnDDn surpassed four competing LDA identification methods (SDLDA, LDNFSGB, IPCARF, LDASR) on the lncRNADisease and MNDR databases under fivefold cross-validation experiments on lncRNAs, diseases, LDPs, and independent lncRNAs and independent diseases, respectively. Ablation experiments further validated the powerful LDA prediction performance of GEnDDn. Furthermore, we utilized GEnDDn to find underlying lncRNAs for lung cancer and breast cancer. The results elucidated that there may be dense linkages between IFNG-AS1 and lung cancer as well as between HIF1A-AS1 and breast cancer. The results require further biomedical experimental verification. GEnDDn is publicly available at https://github.com/plhhnu/GEnDDn.

    Title: The response of pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma to platinum and olaparib therapy in a germline BRCA2 variant carrier: case report and literature review.
    Authors: Matsubayashi H, Todaka A, Tsushima T, Kiyozumi Y, Harada R, Ishihara E, Higashigawa S, Ohike N, Sakamoto H, Sato J, Ishiwatari H, Sugiura T, Uesaka K
    Abstract: A 73-year-old Japanese man with a history of distal biliary cancer treated by pancreatoduodenectomy developed pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (PACC) treated by remnant pancreatectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy. Thirteen months after surgery, multiple liver metastases developed and FOLFOX chemotherapy was initiated. Based on the PACC diagnosis and a positive family history for breast and ovarian cancer genetic testing was performed which revealed a pathogenic germline BRCA2 variant (c.8629G > T, p.Glu2877Ter). Olaparib therapy was initiated and the metastases responded well (partial response). PACC is a BRCA2-associated cancer which may respond well to PARP inhibitors.

    Title: Ultrasensitive and Rapid Circulating Tumor DNA Liquid Biopsy Using Surface-Confined Gene Amplification on Dispersible Magnetic Nano-Electrodes.
    Authors: Park BC, Soh JO, Choi HJ, Park HS, Lee SM, Fu HE, Kim MS, Ko MJ, Koo TM, Lee JY, Kim YK, Lee JH
    Abstract: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) detection has been acknowledged as a promising liquid biopsy approach for cancer diagnosis, with various ctDNA assays used for early detection and treatment monitoring. Dispersible magnetic nanoparticle-based electrochemical detection methods have been proposed as promising candidates for ctDNA detection based on the detection performance and features of the platform material. This study proposes a nanoparticle surface-localized genetic amplification approach by integrating Fe(3)O(4)-Au core-shell nanoparticles into polymerase chain reactions (PCR). These highly dispersible and magnetically responsive superparamagnetic nanoparticles act as nano-electrodes that amplify and accumulate target ctDNA in situ on the nanoparticle surface upon PCR amplification. These nanoparticles are subsequently captured and subjected to repetitive electrochemical measurements to induce reconfiguration-mediated signal amplification for ultrasensitive ( approximately 3 aM) and rapid ( approximately 7 min) metastatic breast cancer ctDNA detection in vitro. The detection platform can also detect metastatic biomarkers from in vivo samples, highlighting the potential for clinical applications and further expansion to rapid and ultrasensitive multiplex detection of various cancers.

    Title: Impact of obesity on sentinel lymph node biopsy outcomes and survival in breast cancer patients: A single-center retrospective study.
    Authors: Pang J, Li L, Yin N, Dai M, Zheng S, Chen M, Xue J, Wu J
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a common choice for axillary surgery in patients with early-stage breast cancer (BC) who have clinically negative lymph nodes. Most research indicates that obesity is a prognostic factor for BC patients, but studies assessing its association with the rate of positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) and the prognosis of patients with early BC undergoing SLNB are limited. METHODS: Between 2013 and 2016, 7062 early-stage BC patients from the Shanghai Cancer Center of Fudan University were included. Based on the Chinese Body Mass Index (BMI) classification standards, the patients were divided into three groups as follows: normal weight, overweight, and obese. Propensity score matching analysis was used to balance the baseline characteristics of the participants. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between obesity and positive SLN rate. Cox regression analysis was used to investigate whether obesity was an independent prognostic factor for early-stage BC patients who had undergone SLNB. RESULTS: No significant association was observed between obesity and positive SLN rate in early-stage BC patients who had undergone SLNB. However, multivariate analysis revealed that compared to patients with normal BMI, the overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 2.240, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27-3.95, p = 0.005) and disease-free survival (HR 1.750, 95% CI 1.16-2.62, p = 0.007) were poorer in patients with high BMI. CONCLUSION: Obesity is an independent prognostic factor for early-stage BC patients who undergo SLNB; however, it does not affect the positive SLN rate.

    Title: Trastuzumab deruxtecan in previously treated HER2-positive metastatic or unresectable breast cancer: Real-life data from the temporary use authorization program in France.
    Authors: Petit T, Hajjaji N, Antoine EC, Benderra MA, Gozy M, Foa C, Mouysset JL, Grenier J, Mousseau M, Mailliez A, Saghatchian M, Lachaier E, Desmoulins I, Hennequin A, Maes P, Loirat D, Ricci F, Dieras V, Berton D, Tiong FL, Teixeira L, Dohollou N, Levy C, Bachelot T, Pierga JY
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Early access program (formerly cohort Temporary Authorization for Use) was granted for trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) in France based on DESTINY-Breast01 trial which demonstrated its efficacy and safety in HER2-positive metastatic/unresectable breast cancer after >/=2 anti-HER2-based regimens received at metastatic stage. METHODS: This multicenter real-world early access program included HER2-positive metastatic/unresectable breast patients pretreated with at least two lines of anti-HER2 regimens who received T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg intravenously in monotherapy every 3 weeks. RESULTS: Four hundred and fifty-nine patients (median age, 58 years; hormone receptor-positive, 67%; brain metastases, 28.1%) received T-DXd. Before inclusion, 81.7% of patients had radiation therapy and 76.5% had undergone surgery. Median number of prior metastatic treatment lines was four (range, 2-22); 99.8% patients had received trastuzumab, 94.8% trastuzumab emtansine and 79.3% pertuzumab. Follow-up was performed from September 30, 2020 to March 30, 2021; when the early access program stopped, the median duration of T-DXd treatment was 3.4 (range, 0-7.8) months. In 160 patients with available tumor assessment, objective response rate was 56.7% and 12.1% had progression. In 57 patients with available brain tumor assessment, complete or partial intracranial response was reported for 35.7% patients and 5.4% had progression. A total of 17 (3.7%) patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) was reported with no cases of ILD-related death. CONCLUSIONS: In this early access program in patients with heavily pretreated HER2-positive metastatic/unresectable breast cancer, T-DXd had antitumor activity with a similar response to that reported in previous clinical studies. T-DXd was well tolerated and no new safety signals were observed.

    Title: Improvement of Phased Antenna Array Applied in Focused Microwave Breast Hyperthermia.
    Authors: Wang X, Xi Z, Ye K, Gong Z, Chen Y, Wang X
    Abstract: Focused microwave breast hyperthermia (FMBH) employs a phased antenna array to perform beamforming that can focus microwave energy at targeted breast tumors. Selective heating of the tumor endows the hyperthermia treatment with high accuracy and low side effects. The effect of FMBH is highly dependent on the applied phased antenna array. This work investigates the effect of polarizations of antenna elements on the microwave-focusing results by simulations. We explore two kinds of antenna arrays with the same number of elements using different digital realistic human breast phantoms. The first array has all the elements' polarization in the vertical plane of the breast, while the second array has half of the elements' polarization in the vertical plane and the other half in the transverse plane, i.e., cross polarization. In total, 96 sets of different simulations are performed, and the results show that the second array leads to a better focusing effect in dense breasts than the first array. This work is very meaningful for the potential improvement of the antenna array for FMBH, which is of great significance for the future clinical applications of FMBH. The antenna array with cross polarization can also be applied in microwave imaging and sensing for biomedical applications.

    Title: Advancing Evidence Generation for Circulating Tumor DNA: Lessons Learned from A Multi-Assay Study of Baseline Circulating Tumor DNA Levels across Cancer Types and Stages.
    Authors: McKelvey BA, Andrews HS, Baehner FL, Chen J, Espenschied CR, Fabrizio D, Gorton V, Gould C, Guinney J, Jones G, Lv X, Nahorski MS, Palomares MR, Pestano GA, Sausen M, Silk A, Zhang N, Zhang Z, Stewart MD, Allen JD
    Abstract: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) holds promise as a biomarker for predicting clinical responses to therapy in solid tumors, and multiple ctDNA assays are in development. However, the heterogeneity in ctDNA levels prior to treatment (baseline) across different cancer types and stages and across ctDNA assays has not been widely studied. Friends of Cancer Research formed a collaboration across multiple commercial ctDNA assay developers to assess baseline ctDNA levels across five cancer types in early- and late-stage disease. This retrospective study included eight commercial ctDNA assay developers providing summary-level de-identified data for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), bladder, breast, prostate, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma following a common analysis protocol. Baseline ctDNA levels across late-stage cancer types were similarly detected, highlighting the potential use of ctDNA as a biomarker in these cancer types. Variability was observed in ctDNA levels across assays in early-stage NSCLC, indicative of the contribution of assay analytical performance and methodology on variability. We identified key data elements, including assay characteristics and clinicopathological metadata, that need to be standardized for future meta-analyses across multiple assays. This work facilitates evidence generation opportunities to support the use of ctDNA as a biomarker for clinical response.

    Title: Exploring CDKN1A Upregulation Mechanisms: Insights into Cell Cycle Arrest Induced by NC2603 Curcumin Analog in MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells.
    Authors: Nishimura FG, Sampaio BB, Komoto TT, da Silva WJ, da Costa MMG, Haddad GI, Peronni KC, Evangelista AF, Hossain M, Dimmock JR, Bandy B, Beleboni RO, Marins M, Fachin AL
    Abstract: Breast cancer stands out as one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, necessitating a nuanced understanding of its molecular underpinnings for effective treatment. Hormone receptors in breast cancer cells substantially influence treatment strategies, dictating therapeutic approaches in clinical settings, serving as a guide for drug development, and aiming to enhance treatment specificity and efficacy. Natural compounds, such as curcumin, offer a diverse array of chemical structures with promising therapeutic potential. Despite curcumin's benefits, challenges like poor solubility and rapid metabolism have spurred the exploration of analogs. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of the curcumin analog NC2603 to induce cell cycle arrest in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and explored its molecular mechanisms. Our findings reveal potent inhibition of cell viability (IC50 = 5.6 muM) and greater specificity than doxorubicin toward MCF-7 vs. non-cancer HaCaT cells. Transcriptome analysis identified 12,055 modulated genes, most notably upregulation of GADD45A and downregulation of ESR1, implicating CDKN1A-mediated regulation of proliferation and cell cycle genes. We hypothesize that the curcumin analog by inducing GADD45A expression and repressing ESR1, triggers the expression of CDKN1A, which in turn downregulates the expression of many important genes of proliferation and the cell cycle. These insights advance our understanding of curcumin analogs' therapeutic potential, highlighting not just their role in treatment, but also the molecular pathways involved in their activity toward breast cancer cells.

    Title: A Nanorobotics-Based Approach of Breast Cancer in the Nanotechnology Era.
    Authors: Neagu AN, Jayaweera T, Weraduwage K, Darie CC
    Abstract: We are living in an era of advanced nanoscience and nanotechnology. Numerous nanomaterials, culminating in nanorobots, have demonstrated ingenious applications in biomedicine, including breast cancer (BC) nano-theranostics. To solve the complicated problem of BC heterogeneity, non-targeted drug distribution, invasive diagnostics or surgery, resistance to classic onco-therapies and real-time monitoring of tumors, nanorobots are designed to perform multiple tasks at a small scale, even at the organelles or molecular level. Over the last few years, most nanorobots have been bioengineered as biomimetic and biocompatible nano(bio)structures, resembling different organisms and cells, such as urchin, spider, octopus, fish, spermatozoon, flagellar bacterium or helicoidal cyanobacterium. In this review, readers will be able to deepen their knowledge of the structure, behavior and role of several types of nanorobots, among other nanomaterials, in BC theranostics. We summarized here the characteristics of many functionalized nanodevices designed to counteract the main neoplastic hallmark features of BC, from sustaining proliferation and evading anti-growth signaling and resisting programmed cell death to inducing angiogenesis, activating invasion and metastasis, preventing genomic instability, avoiding immune destruction and deregulating autophagy. Most of these nanorobots function as targeted and self-propelled smart nano-carriers or nano-drug delivery systems (nano-DDSs), enhancing the efficiency and safety of chemo-, radio- or photodynamic therapy, or the current imagistic techniques used in BC diagnosis. Most of these nanorobots have been tested in vitro, using various BC cell lines, as well as in vivo, mainly based on mice models. We are still waiting for nanorobots that are low-cost, as well as for a wider transition of these favorable effects from laboratory to clinical practice.

    Title: Micronutrient Status and Breast Cancer: A Narrative Review.
    Authors: Forma A, Grunwald A, Zembala P, Januszewski J, Brachet A, Zembala R, Swiatek K, Baj J
    Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, at the same time being one of the most prevalent causes of women's death. Many factors such as alcohol, weight fluctuations, or hormonal replacement therapy can potentially contribute to breast cancer development and progression. Another important factor in breast cancer onset includes micronutrient status. In this narrative review, we analyzed 23 micronutrients and their possible influence on breast cancer onset and progression. Further, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of micronutrient status on the prevention of breast cancer and its possible influence on various therapeutic pathways. We researched meta-analyses, systemic and narrative reviews, retrospective studies, as well as original studies on human and animal models. The results of these studies indicate a possible correlation between the different levels of micronutrients and a decreased risk of breast cancer as well as a better survival rate. However, further studies are necessary to establish adequate doses of supplementation of the chosen micronutrients and the exact mechanisms of micronutrient impact on breast cancer therapy.

    Title: Anticancer Effects of Mitoquinone via Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis in Canine Mammary Gland Tumor Cells.
    Authors: Lee R, Lee WY, Park HJ
    Abstract: Treating female canine mammary gland tumors is crucial owing to their propensity for rapid progression and metastasis, significantly impacting the overall health and well-being of dogs. Mitoquinone (MitoQ), an antioxidant, has shown promise in inhibiting the migration, invasion, and clonogenicity of human breast cancer cells. Thus, we investigated MitoQ's potential anticancer properties against canine mammary gland tumor cells, CMT-U27 and CF41.Mg. MitoQ markedly suppressed the proliferation and migration of both CMT-U27 and CF41.Mg cells and induced apoptotic cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, treatment with MitoQ led to increased levels of pro-apoptotic proteins, including cleaved-caspase3, BAX, and phospho-p53. Cell cycle analysis revealed that MitoQ hindered cell progression in the G1 and S phases in CMT-U27 and CF41.Mg cells. These findings were supported using western blot analysis, demonstrating elevated levels of cleaved caspase-3, a hallmark of apoptosis, and decreased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2 and cyclin D4, pivotal regulators of the cell cycle. In conclusion, MitoQ exhibits in vitro antitumor effects by inducing apoptosis and arresting the cell cycle in canine mammary gland tumors, suggesting its potential as a preventive or therapeutic agent against canine mammary cancer.

    Title: Clinical and Biologic Correlates of ADORA2A Transcriptomic Expression in Cancer.
    Authors: Shreenivas A, Nishizaki D, Lee S, Pabla S, Nesline M, Conroy JM, DePietro P, Kato S, Kurzrock R
    Abstract: ADORA2A (adenosine A2a receptor) and ADORA2B propagate immunoregulatory signals, including restricting both innate and adaptive immunity, though recent data also suggest a tumor suppressor effect in certain settings. We evaluated the RNA expression from 514 tumors in a clinical-grade laboratory; 489 patients with advanced/metastatic disease had clinical outcome correlates. Transcript expression was standardized to internal housekeeping genes and ranked (0-100 scale) relative to 735 specimens from 35 different cancer types. Transcript abundance rank values were defined as "low/moderate" (0-74) or "high" (75-100) percentile RNA expression ranks. Overall, 20.8% of tumors had high ADORA2A (>/=75 percentile RNA rank). The greatest proportion of high ADORA2A expressors was found in neuroendocrine and breast cancers and sarcomas, whereas the lowest was found in colorectal and ovarian cancers, albeit with patient-to-patient variability. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, there was a significant positive correlation between high ADORA2A RNA expression and a high expression of the immune checkpoint-related molecules PD-1 (p = 0.015), VISTA (p </= 0.001), CD38 (p = 0.031), and CD39 (p </= 0.001). In 217 immunotherapy-treated patients, high ADORA2A did not correlate significantly with progression-free (p = 0.51) or overall survival (OS) (p = 0.09) from the initiation of the checkpoint blockade. However, high versus not-high ADORA2A transcript expression correlated with longer OS from the time of advanced/metastatic disease (N = 489 patients; (HR 0.69 (95% CI 0.51-0.95) (p = 0.02)). Therefore, high ADORA2A transcript levels may be a favorable prognostic factor, unrelated to immunotherapy. Importantly, ascertaining co-expression patterns of ADORA2A with PD-1 and VISTA in individual tumors as a basis for the precision co-targeting of ADORA2A and these other checkpoint-related molecules warrants investigation in clinical trials.

    Title: Type II Interleukin-4 Receptor Activation in Basal Breast Cancer Cells Promotes Tumor Progression via Metabolic and Epigenetic Modulation.
    Authors: Williams D, Hargrove-Wiley E, Bindeman W, Valent D, Miranda AX, Beckstead J, Fingleton B
    Abstract: Interleukin-4 (IL4) is a Th2 cytokine that can signal through two different receptors, one of which-the type II receptor-is overexpressed by various cancer cells. Previously, we have shown that type II IL4 receptor signaling increases proliferation and metastasis in mouse models of breast cancer, as well as increasing glucose and glutamine metabolism. Here, we expand on those findings to determine mechanistically how IL4 signaling links glucose metabolism and histone acetylation to drive proliferation in the context of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We used a combination of cellular, biochemical, and genomics approaches to interrogate TNBC cell lines, which represent a cancer type where high expression of the type II IL4 receptor is linked to reduced survival. Our results indicate that type II IL4 receptor activation leads to increased glucose uptake, Akt and ACLY activation, and histone acetylation in TNBC cell lines. Inhibition of glucose uptake through the deletion of Glut1 ablates IL4-induced proliferation. Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of histone acetyltransferase P300 attenuates IL4-mediated gene expression and proliferation in vitro. Our work elucidates a role for type II IL4 receptor signaling in promoting TNBC progression, and highlights type II IL4 signaling, as well as histone acetylation, as possible targets for therapy.

    Title: Biological Roles and Clinical Applications of Exosomes in Breast Cancer: A Brief Review.
    Authors: Wang H, Wang R, Shen K, Huang R, Wang Z
    Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) is a global health risk for women and has a high prevalence rate. The drug resistance, recurrence, and metastasis of BC affect patient prognosis, thus posing a challenge to scientists. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles (EVs) that originate from various cells; they have a double-layered lipid membrane structure and contain rich biological information. They mediate intercellular communication and have pivotal roles in tumor development, progression, and metastasis and drug resistance. Exosomes are important cell communication mediators in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Exosomes are utilized as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for estimating the treatment efficacy of BC and have the potential to function as tools to enable the targeted delivery of antitumor drugs. This review introduces recent progress in research on how exosomes influence tumor development and the TME. We also present the research progress on the application of exosomes as prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers and drug delivery tools.

    Title: BMP Stimulation Differentially Affects Phosphorylation and Protein Stability of beta-Catenin in Breast Cancer Cell Lines.
    Authors: Ilhan M, Hastar N, Kampfrath B, Spierling DN, Jatzlau J, Knaus P
    Abstract: Increased expression and nuclear translocation of beta-CATENIN is frequently observed in breast cancer, and it correlates with poor prognosis. Current treatment strategies targeting beta-CATENIN are not as efficient as desired. Therefore, detailed understanding of beta-CATENIN regulation is crucial. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) and Wingless/Integrated (WNT) pathway crosstalk is well-studied for many cancer types including colorectal cancer, whereas it is still poorly understood for breast cancer. Analysis of breast cancer patient data revealed that BMP2 and BMP6 were significantly downregulated in tumors. Since mutation frequency in genes enhancing beta-CATENIN protein stability is relatively low in breast cancer, we aimed to investigate whether decreased BMP ligand expression could contribute to a high protein level of beta-CATENIN in breast cancer cells. We demonstrated that downstream of BMP stimulation, SMAD4 is required to reduce beta-CATENIN protein stability through the phosphorylation in MCF7 and T47D cells. Consequently, BMP stimulation reduces beta-CATENIN levels and prevents its nuclear translocation and target gene expression in MCF7 cells. Conversely, BMP stimulation has no effect on beta-CATENIN phosphorylation or stability in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. Likewise, SMAD4 modulation does not alter the response of those cells, indicating that SMAD4 alone is insufficient for BMP-induced beta-CATENIN phosphorylation. While our data suggest that considering BMP activity may serve as a prognostic marker for understanding beta-CATENIN accumulation risk, further investigation is needed to elucidate the differential responsiveness of breast cancer cell lines.

    Title: Antioxidant and Cytotoxic Properties of Berberis vulgaris (L.) Stem Bark Dry Extract.
    Authors: Ivan IM, Olaru OT, Popovici V, Chitescu CL, Popescu L, Luta EA, Ilie EI, Brasoveanu LI, Hotnog CM, Nitulescu GM, Boscencu R, Gird CE
    Abstract: Berberis vulgaris (L.) has remarkable ethnopharmacological properties and is widely used in traditional medicine. The present study investigated B. vulgaris stem bark (Berberidis cortex) by extraction with 50% ethanol. The main secondary metabolites were quantified, resulting in a polyphenols content of 17.6780 +/- 3.9320 mg Eq tannic acid/100 g extract, phenolic acids amount of 3.3886 +/- 0.3481 mg Eq chlorogenic acid/100 g extract and 78.95 microg/g berberine. The dried hydro-ethanolic extract (BVE) was thoroughly analyzed using Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled with High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS/MS) and HPLC, and 40 bioactive phenolic constituents were identified. Then, the antioxidant potential of BVE was evaluated using three methods. Our results could explain the protective effects of Berberidis cortex EC(50)FRAP = 0.1398 mg/mL, IC(50)ABTS = 0.0442 mg/mL, IC(50)DPPH = 0.2610 mg/mL compared to ascorbic acid (IC(50) = 0.0165 mg/mL). Next, the acute toxicity and teratogenicity of BVE and berberine-berberine sulfate hydrate (BS)-investigated on Daphnia sp. revealed significant BS toxicity after 24 h, while BVE revealed considerable toxicity after 48 h and induced embryonic developmental delays. Finally, the anticancer effects of BVE and BS were evaluated in different tumor cell lines after 24 and 48 h of treatments. The MTS assay evidenced dose- and time-dependent antiproliferative activity, which was higher for BS than BVE. The strongest diminution of tumor cell viability was recorded in the breast (MDA-MB-231), colon (LoVo) cancer, and OSCC (PE/CA-PJ49) cell lines after 48 h of exposure (IC(50) < 100 microg/mL). However, no cytotoxicity was reported in the normal epithelial cells (HUVEC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HT-29) cell lines. Extensive data analysis supports our results, showing a significant correlation between the BVE concentration, phenolic compounds content, antioxidant activity, exposure time, and the viability rate of various normal cells and cancer cell lines.

    Title: Splenic Elemental Composition of Breast Cancer-Suffering Rats Supplemented with Pomegranate Seed Oil and Bitter Melon Extract.
    Authors: Bialek M, Lepionka T, Wojtak W, Ruszczynska A, Bulska E, Czauderna M, Bialek A
    Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate how dietary modifications with pomegranate seed oil (PSO) and bitter melon aqueous extract (BME) affect mineral content in the spleen of rats both under normal physiological conditions and with coexisting mammary tumorigenesis. The diet of Sprague-Dawley female rats was supplemented either with PSO or with BME, or with a combination for 21 weeks. A chemical carcinogen (7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene) was applied intragastrically to induce mammary tumors. In the spleen of rats, the selected elements were determined with a quadrupole mass spectrometer with inductively coupled plasma ionization (ICP-MS). ANOVA was used to evaluate differences in elemental composition among experimental groups. Multivariate statistical methods were used to discover whether some subtle dependencies exist between experimental factors and thus influence the element content. Experimental factors affected the splenic levels of macroelements, except for potassium. Both diet modification and the cancerogenic process resulted in significant changes in the content of Fe, Se, Co, Cr, Ni, Al, Sr, Pb, Cd, B, and Tl in rat spleen. Chemometric analysis revealed the greatest impact of the ongoing carcinogenic process on the mineral composition of the spleen. The obtained results may contribute to a better understanding of peripheral immune organ functioning, especially during the neoplastic process, and thus may help develop anticancer prevention and treatment strategies.

    Abstract: Background: Oncological treatment of breast cancer may be associated with adverse effects on myocardial function. Objectives: The objective of this study was to compare the influence of three oncological treatment methods of intervention on the echocardiographic (ECHO) parameters of left ventricular function. Materials and Methods: One hundred and fifty-five women with breast cancer were divided into three groups depending on the type of therapy used: group I (AC)-anthracyclines; group II (AC + TZ)-anthracyclines + trastuzumab; and group III (RTls+)-anthracyclines with or without trastuzumab + left-sided radiotherapy. Prospective ECHO examinations were performed at baseline and every 3 months, up to 12 months from the start of the therapy. Patients with a history of chemotherapy or who were diagnosed with heart disease were not included in the study. Results: Out of 155 patients, 3 died due to cancer as the primary cause, and 12 withdrew their consent for further observation. Baseline systolic and diastolic ECHO parameters did not differ between the analyzed groups. Cardiotoxicity, according to the LVEF criteria, occurred during follow-up in 20 patients (14.3%), irrespective of the treatment method used. Diastolic echocardiographic parameters did not change significantly after 12 months in each group, except for the left atrial volume index (LAVi), which was significantly higher in the AC + TZ compared to the values in the RTls+ group. Conclusions: All three oncologic therapeutic modalities in women with breast cancer showed no significant differences in relation to the incidence of echocardiographic cardiotoxicity criterion; however, transient systolic decrease in LVEF was most frequently observed in the AC + TZ therapeutic regimen. Left-sided radiotherapy was not associated with excess left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction during a 12-month follow-up period. The predictors of negative changes in diastolic parameters included age and combined anthracycline and trastuzumab therapy.

    Title: Risk of Skin Cancer in Patients with Psoriasis: Single-Center Retrospective Study Comparing Anti-TNFalpha and Phototherapy.
    Authors: Trovato E, Dragotto M, Capalbo E, Cartocci A, Rubegni P, Calabrese L
    Abstract: Background: The risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) in patients with psoriasis is highly debated, and, to date, there is no unambiguous consensus opinion. Psoriasis is known to be related to an increased likelihood of other comorbidities such as psoriatic arthritis, obesity, metabolic syndrome, depression, and cardiovascular disease. Regarding cancer risk, previous studies have reported a greater tendency for the development of cutaneous T-lymphomas and colon, breast, kidney, and lung cancers. Furthermore, data from network meta-analyses have shown that patients with psoriasis have a higher risk of developing squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and/or basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). Multiple factors may contribute to the development of NMSCs in psoriatic patients, ranging from immunosuppression induced by biologic agents to previous phototherapy. However, the extent to which each factor may impact this risk has not been entirely assessed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of developing NMSCs in patients with psoriasis observed for at least 5 years, by directly comparing patients only treated with phototherapy and patients treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) agents, naive to other systemic treatments or phototherapy. Methods: We conducted a single-center retrospective study at Siena University Hospital, Italy, on 200 adult patients with psoriasis divided into two groups: (i) group 1, including 100 patients treated with narrow-band UVB phototherapy (nb-UVB), and (ii) group 2, including 100 patients treated with anti-TNFalpha. The patients included in group 2 had to be naive to cDMARDs and biologics and treated with anti-TNFalpha continuously for 5 years without loss of efficacy. All patients were observed for 5 years and underwent annual dermatologic examinations to assess for the occurrence of BCC or SCC. Results: A total of 34 out of 100 patients treated with phototherapy had one BCC or one SCC and 10 out of 34 developed two skin cancers. In particular, five had both types (one BCC and one SCC), and five had two BCCs. Conclusions: The results of our study highlight how the risk of developing NMSCs is greater in patients undergoing phototherapy compared to those treated with anti-TNFalpha. It also draws attention to the consideration that patients with scalp psoriasis might need closer follow-up as they could be more at risk of developing NMSCs.

    Title: Quantum Dot Research in Breast Cancer: Challenges and Prospects.
    Authors: Omidian H, Wilson RL, Cubeddu LX
    Abstract: The multifaceted role of quantum dots (QDs) in breast cancer research highlights significant advancements in diagnostics, targeted therapy, and drug delivery systems. This comprehensive review addresses the development of precise imaging techniques for early cancer detection and the use of QDs in enhancing the specificity of therapeutic delivery, particularly in challenging cases like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The paper also discusses the critical understanding of QDs' interactions with cancer cells, offering insights into their potential for inducing cytotoxic effects and facilitating gene therapy. Limitations such as biocompatibility, toxicity concerns, and the transition from laboratory to clinical practice are critically analyzed. Future directions emphasize safer, non-toxic QD development, improved targeting mechanisms, and the integration of QDs into personalized medicine, aiming to overcome the current challenges and enhance breast cancer management.

    Title: Real-World Data Analysis of CDK4/6 Inhibitor Therapy-A Patient-Centric Single Center Study.
    Authors: Ge I, Berner K, Mathis M, Hensgen C, Mayer S, Erbes T, Juhasz-Boss I, Asberger J
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: The quest to comprehend the real-world efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDKis) in breast cancer continues, as patient responses vary significantly. METHODS: This single-center retrospective study evaluated CDKi use outside the trial condition from November 2016 to May 2020. Progression-free survival (PFS), time-to-treatment failure (TTF), short-term and prolonged treatment benefit (>/=4 and >/=10 months), as well as prognostic and predictive markers were assessed with Kaplan-Meier and multivariate regression analyses. RESULTS: Out of 86 identified patients, 58 (67.4%) had treatment failure of which 40 (46.5%) were due to progression. Median PFS and TTF were 12 and 8.5 months, respectively. A total of 57 (66.3%) and 42 (48.8%) patients experienced short-term and prolonged treatment benefit. Independent, significant predictors for PFS were progesterone receptor expression (HR: 0.88), multiple metastatic sites (HR: 2.56), and hepatic metastasis (HR: 2.01). Significant predictors for TTF were PR expression (HR: 0.86), multiple sites (HR: 3.29), adverse events (HR: 2.35), and diabetes (HR: 2.88). Aside from tumor biology and adverse events, treatment modifications like pausing and switching of CDKi were predictive for short-term (OR: 6.73) and prolonged (OR: 14.27) therapeutic benefit, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These findings emphasize the importance of tailored treatment strategies, highlighting the role of PR expression, metastatic burden, and therapeutic adjustments in optimizing patient outcomes in real-world breast cancer management.

    Title: Activation of the Anaphase Promoting Complex Restores Impaired Mitotic Progression and Chemosensitivity in Multiple Drug-Resistant Human Breast Cancer.
    Authors: Lubachowski M, VanGenderen C, Valentine S, Belak Z, Davies GF, Arnason TG, Harkness TAA
    Abstract: The development of multiple-drug-resistant (MDR) cancer all too often signals the need for toxic alternative therapy or palliative care. Our recent in vivo and in vitro studies using canine MDR lymphoma cancer cells demonstrate that the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC) is impaired in MDR cells compared to normal canine control and drug-sensitive cancer cells. Here, we sought to establish whether this phenomena is a generalizable mechanism independent of species, malignancy type, or chemotherapy regime. To test the association of blunted APC activity with MDR cancer behavior, we used matched parental and MDR MCF7 human breast cancer cells, and a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of human triple-negative breast cancer. We show that APC activating mechanisms, such as APC subunit 1 (APC1) phosphorylation and CDC27/CDC20 protein associations, are reduced in MCF7 MDR cells when compared to chemo-sensitive matched cell lines. Consistent with impaired APC function in MDR cells, APC substrate proteins failed to be effectively degraded. Similar to our previous observations in canine MDR lymphoma cells, chemical activation of the APC using Mad2 Inhibitor-1 (M2I-1) in MCF7 MDR cells enhanced APC substrate degradation and resensitized MDR cells in vitro to the cytotoxic effects of the alkylating chemotherapeutic agent, doxorubicin (DOX). Using cell cycle arrest/release experiments, we show that mitosis is delayed in MDR cells with elevated substrate levels. When pretreated with M2I-1, MDR cells progress through mitosis at a faster rate that coincides with reduced levels of APC substrates. In our PDX model, mice growing a clinically MDR human triple-negative breast cancer tumor show significantly reduced tumor growth when treated with M2I-1, with evidence of increased DNA damage and apoptosis. Thus, our results strongly support the hypothesis that APC impairment is a driver of aggressive tumor development and that targeting the APC for activation has the potential for meaningful clinical benefits in treating recurrent cases of MDR malignancy.

    Title: Real-World Experience among Elderly Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients Treated with CDK4/6 Inhibitor-Based Therapy.
    Authors: O'Connor TN, Schultz E, Wang J, O'Connor T, Levine E, Knudsen ES, Witkiewicz AK
    Abstract: The largest portion of breast cancer patients diagnosed after 70 years of age present with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer subtypes. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor treatment, in conjunction with endocrine therapy, has become standard-of-care for metastatic HR+ breast cancer. In total, 320 patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving CDK4/6 inhibitor combined with fulvestrant or an aromatase inhibitor were enrolled in an ongoing observational study or were included in an IRB-approved retrospective study. All patients receiving CDK4/6 inhibitor-based therapy that were >/=70 years of age (n = 111) displayed prolonged progression-free survival (27.6 months) as compared to patients <70 years of age (n = 209, 21.1 months, HR = 1.38, p < 0.05). Specifically, patients receiving a CDK4/6 inhibitor with an aromatase inhibitor who were >/=70 years of age (n = 79) displayed exceptionally prolonged progression-free survival (46.0 months) as compared to patients receiving the same treatment who were <70 years of age (n = 161, 21.8 months, HR = 1.71, p < 0.01). However, patients >/=70 years of age also experienced more frequent adverse responses to CDK4/6 inhibitor-based treatment leading to dose reduction, hold, or discontinuation than the younger cohort (69% and 53%, respectively). Treatment strategies that may decrease toxicity without affecting efficacy (such as dose titration) are worth further exploration.

    Title: Challenges and Opportunities in Breast Cancer Care in Low-Resourced Countries, Jordan as An Example.
    Authors: Abdel-Razeq H, Mansour A
    Abstract: Jordan is a relatively small country with a rapidly growing population and a challenged economy. Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer among women worldwide and also in Jordan. Though the age-standardized rate (ASR) of breast cancer incidence is still lower than that in Western societies, the number of newly diagnosed cases continues to increase, involving younger women, and new cases are usually detected at more advanced stages. Improvements in breast cancer care across the health care continuum, including early detection, prevention, treatment, and survivorship and palliative care, have become very visible, but may not match the magnitude of the problem. More organized, goal-oriented work is urgently needed to downstage the disease and improve awareness of, access to, and participation in early detection programs. The cost of recently introduced anti-cancer therapies poses a great challenge, but the impact of these therapies on treatment outcomes, including overall survival, is becoming very noticeable. Though the concept of a multidisciplinary approach to breast cancer treatment is often used at most health care facilities, its implementation in real practice varies significantly. The availability of breast reconstruction procedures, survivorship programs, germline genetic testing, counselling, and palliative care is improving, but these are not widely practiced. In this manuscript, we review the status of breast cancer in Jordan and highlight some of the existing challenges and opportunities.

    Title: Racial and Ethnic Disparities in European Breast Cancer Clinical Trials.
    Authors: Bania A, Adamou A, Saloustros E
    Abstract: Breast cancer is the most prevalent female cancer worldwide with known correlations between the race and tumor characteristics of the patients and prognosis. International and US-based studies, however, have reported a disproportionate representation of Black and Hispanic patients in clinical trials. This is the first study assessing race and ethnicity reporting trends and inclusion in European breast cancer trials. The PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were systematically searched for trials on breast cancer treatment conducted exclusively in Europe between 2010 and 2022. Of the 97 identified trials, race was reported in 10.31%. Multinational participation, but not the study size or trial phase, was significantly associated with higher race reporting trends. These 10 trials featured a White-predominant population, with 1.08% Asian and 0.88% Black patients included. The acquisition of the race and ethnicity data of patients in European trials is lower compared to the U.S. or worldwide studies and does not permit extensive analysis of minority participation. In a limited analysis, the low rates of minority participation are concerning, based on population-based data on minorities in select European countries. These observations should encourage race reporting practices in European breast cancer trials and adequate minority participation to support the generalizability of the results of the studies and promote healthcare equity.

    Title: Synergistic Action of Benzyl Isothiocyanate and Sorafenib in a Nanoparticle Delivery System for Enhanced Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Treatment.
    Authors: Wang Q, Cheng N, Wang W, Bao Y
    Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) presents a therapeutic challenge due to its complex pathology and limited treatment options. Addressing this challenge, our study focuses on the effectiveness of combination therapy, which has recently become a critical strategy in cancer treatment, improving therapeutic outcomes and combating drug resistance and metastasis. We explored a novel combination therapy employing Benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) and Sorafenib (SOR) and their nanoformulation, aiming to enhance therapeutic outcomes against TNBC. Through a series of in vitro assays, we assessed the cytotoxic effects of BITC and SOR, both free and encapsulated. The BITC-SOR-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized using an amphiphilic copolymer, which demonstrated a uniform spherical morphology and favorable size distribution. The encapsulation efficiencies, as well as the sustained release profiles at varied pH levels, were quantified, revealing distinct kinetics that were well-modeled by the Korsmeyer-Peppas equation. The NP delivery system showed a marked dose-dependent cytotoxicity towards TNBC cells, with an IC50 of 7.8 muM for MDA-MB-231 cells, indicating improved efficacy over free drugs, while exhibiting minimal toxicity toward normal breast cells. Furthermore, the NPs significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion in TNBC models, surpassing the effects of free drugs. These findings underscore the potential of BITC-SOR-NPs as a promising therapeutic approach for TNBC, offering targeted delivery while minimizing systemic toxicity.

    Title: Hypomethylation of ATP1A1 Is Associated with Poor Prognosis and Cancer Progression in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.
    Authors: Kim Y, Ko JY, Kong HK, Lee M, Chung W, Lim S, Son D, Oh S, Park JW, Kim DY, Lee M, Han W, Park WY, Yoo KH, Park JH
    Abstract: Dysregulated DNA methylation in cancer is critical in the transcription machinery associated with cancer progression. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype, but no treatment targeting TNBC biomarkers has yet been developed. To identify specific DNA methylation patterns in TNBC, methyl-binding domain protein 2 (MBD) sequencing data were compared in TNBC and the three other major breast cancer subtypes. Integrated analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression identified a gene set showing a correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression. ATPase Na+/K+-transporting subunit alpha 1 (ATP1A1) was found to be specifically hypomethylated in the coding sequence (CDS) region and to show increased expression in TNBC. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database also showed that hypomethylation and high expression of ATP1A1 were strongly associated with poor survival in patients with TNBC. Furthermore, ATP1A1 knockdown significantly reduced the viability and tumor-sphere formation of TNBC cells. These results suggest that the hypomethylation and overexpression of ATP1A1 could be a prognostic marker in TNBC and that the manipulation of ATP1A1 expression could be a therapeutic target in this disease.

    Title: A Metastatic Cancer Expression Generator (MetGen): A Generative Contrastive Learning Framework for Metastatic Cancer Generation.
    Authors: Liu Z, Chiu YC, Chen Y, Huang Y
    Abstract: Despite significant advances in tumor biology and clinical therapeutics, metastasis remains the primary cause of cancer-related deaths. While RNA-seq technology has been used extensively to study metastatic cancer characteristics, challenges persist in acquiring adequate transcriptomic data. To overcome this challenge, we propose MetGen, a generative contrastive learning tool based on a deep learning model. MetGen generates synthetic metastatic cancer expression profiles using primary cancer and normal tissue expression data. Our results demonstrate that MetGen generates comparable samples to actual metastatic cancer samples, and the cancer and tissue classification yields performance rates of 99.8 +/- 0.2% and 95.0 +/- 2.3%, respectively. A benchmark analysis suggests that the proposed model outperforms traditional generative models such as the variational autoencoder. In metastatic subtype classification, our generated samples show 97.6% predicting power compared to true metastatic samples. Additionally, we demonstrate MetGen's interpretability using metastatic prostate cancer and metastatic breast cancer. MetGen has learned highly relevant signatures in cancer, tissue, and tumor microenvironments, such as immune responses and the metastasis process, which can potentially foster a more comprehensive understanding of metastatic cancer biology. The development of MetGen represents a significant step toward the study of metastatic cancer biology by providing a generative model that identifies candidate therapeutic targets for the treatment of metastatic cancer.

    Title: Liver X Receptor Ligand GAC0001E5 Downregulates Antioxidant Capacity and ERBB2/HER2 Expression in HER2-Positive Breast Cancer Cells.
    Authors: Premaratne A, Basu S, Bagchi A, Zhou T, Feng Q, Lin CY
    Abstract: The HER2-positive subtype accounts for approximately one-fifth of all breast cancers. Insensitivity and development of acquired resistance to targeted therapies in some patients contribute to their poor prognosis. HER2 overexpression is associated with metabolic reprogramming, facilitating cancer cell growth and survival. Novel liver X receptor (LXR) ligand GAC0001E5 (1E5) has been shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation by disrupting glutaminolysis and inducing oxidative stress. In this study, HER2-positive breast cancer cells were treated with 1E5 to determine their potential inhibitory effects and mechanisms of action in HER2-positive breast cancers. Similar to previous observations in other cancer types, 1E5 treatments inhibited LXR activity, expression, and cancer cell proliferation. Expression of fatty acid synthesis genes, including fatty acid synthase (FASN), was downregulated following 1E5 treatment, and results from co-treatment experiments with an FASN inhibitor suggest that the same pathway is targeted by 1E5. Treatments with 1E5 disrupted glutaminolysis and resulted in increased oxidative stress. Strikingly, HER2 transcript and protein levels were both significantly downregulated by 1E5. Taken together, these findings indicate the therapeutic potential of targeting HER2 overexpression and associated metabolic reprogramming via the modulation of LXR in HER2-positive breast cancers.

    Title: The Safety and Efficacy of the Combination of Sacituzumab Govitecan and Palliative Radiotherapy-A Retrospective Multi-Center Cohort Study.
    Authors: Krug D, Tio J, Abaci A, Beurer B, Brugge S, Elsayad K, Meixner E, Park-Simon TW, Smetanay K, Winkelmann F, Wittig A, Wockel A
    Abstract: Sacituzumab govitecan (SG) is a new treatment option for patients with metastatic triple-negative and hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. This antibody-drug conjugate is currently approved as monotherapy. Palliative radiotherapy is frequently used to treat symptomatic metastases locally. Concurrent use of SG and irradiation was excluded in clinical trials of SG, and there are currently limited published data. We report here a systematic review, as well as a retrospective multi-center study of 17 patients with triple-negative breast cancer who received concurrent SG and radiotherapy. In these patients, concurrent use was found to be efficient, safe and well tolerated. There were no apparent differences in moderate or severe acute toxicity according to the timing of SG administration.

    Title: Axillary Surgery for Breast Cancer in 2024.
    Authors: Heidinger M, Weber WP
    Abstract: Axillary surgery for patients with breast cancer (BC) in 2024 is becoming increasingly specific, moving away from the previous 'one size fits all' radical approach. The goal is to spare morbidity whilst maintaining oncologic safety. In the upfront surgery setting, a first landmark randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the omission of any surgical axillary staging in patients with unremarkable clinical examination and axillary ultrasound showed non-inferiority to sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (SLNB). The study population consisted of 87.8% postmenopausal patients with estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative BC. Patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer and up to two positive SLNs can safely be spared axillary dissection (ALND) even in the context of mastectomy or extranodal extension. In patients enrolled in the TAXIS trial, adjuvant systemic treatment was shown to be similar with or without ALND despite the loss of staging information. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), targeted lymph node removal with or without SLNB showed a lower false-negative rate to determine nodal pathological complete response (pCR) compared to SLNB alone. However, oncologic outcomes do not appear to differ in patients with nodal pCR determined by either one of the two concepts, according to a recently published global, retrospective, real-world study. Real-world studies generally have a lower level of evidence than RCTs, but they are feasible quickly and with a large sample size. Another global real-world study provides evidence that even patients with residual isolated tumor cells can be safely spared from ALND. In general, few indications for ALND remain. Three randomized controlled trials are ongoing for patients with clinically node-positive BC in the upfront surgery setting and residual disease after NACT. Pending the results of these trials, ALND remains indicated in these patients.

    Title: Multiplex Digital Spatial Profiling in Breast Cancer Research: State-of-the-Art Technologies and Applications across the Translational Science Spectrum.
    Authors: Rossi M, Radisky DC
    Abstract: While RNA sequencing and multi-omic approaches have significantly advanced cancer diagnosis and treatment, their limitation in preserving critical spatial information has been a notable drawback. This spatial context is essential for understanding cellular interactions and tissue dynamics. Multiplex digital spatial profiling (MDSP) technologies overcome this limitation by enabling the simultaneous analysis of transcriptome and proteome data within the intact spatial architecture of tissues. In breast cancer research, MDSP has emerged as a promising tool, revealing complex biological questions related to disease evolution, identifying biomarkers, and discovering drug targets. This review highlights the potential of MDSP to revolutionize clinical applications, ranging from risk assessment and diagnostics to prognostics, patient monitoring, and the customization of treatment strategies, including clinical trial guidance. We discuss the major MDSP techniques, their applications in breast cancer research, and their integration in clinical practice, addressing both their potential and current limitations. Emphasizing the strategic use of MDSP in risk stratification for women with benign breast disease, we also highlight its transformative potential in reshaping the landscape of breast cancer research and treatment.

    Title: Implementation of a clinical breast exam and referral program in a rural district of Pakistan.
    Authors: Martins RS, Arif A, Yameen S, Noordin S, Masroor T, Muhammad S, Channa M, Soofi SB, Sattar AK
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: The role of clinical breast examination (CBE) for early detection of breast cancer is extremely important in lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) where access to breast imaging is limited. Our study aimed to describe the outcomes of a community outreach breast education, home CBE and referral program for early recognition of breast abnormalities and improvement of breast cancer awareness in a rural district of Pakistan. METHODS: Eight health care workers (HCW) and a gynecologist were educated on basic breast cancer knowledge and trained to create breast cancer awareness and conduct CBE in the community. They were then deployed in the Dadu district of Pakistan where they carried out home visits to perform CBE in the community. Breast cancer awareness was assessed in the community using a standardized questionnaire and standard educational intervention was performed. Clinically detectable breast lesions were identified during home CBE and women were referred to the study gynecologist to confirm the presence of clinical abnormalities. Those confirmed to have clinical abnormalities were referred for imaging. Follow-up home visits were carried out to assess reasons for non-compliance in patients who did not follow-through with the gynecologist appointment or prescribed imaging and re-enforce the need for follow-up. RESULTS: Basic breast cancer knowledge of HCWs and study gynecologist improved post-intervention. HCWs conducted home CBE in 8757 women. Of these, 149 were warranted a CBE by a physician (to avoid missing an abnormality), while 20 were found to have a definitive lump by HCWs, all were referred to the study gynecologist (CBE checkpoint). Only 50% (10/20) of those with a suspected lump complied with the referral to the gynecologist, where 90% concordance was found between their CBEs. Follow-up home visits were conducted in 119/169 non-compliant patients. Major reasons for non-compliance were a lack of understanding of the risks and financial constraints. A significant improvement was observed in the community's breast cancer knowledge at the follow-up visits using the standardized post-test. CONCLUSIONS: Basic and focused education of HCWs can increase their knowledge and dispel myths. Hand-on structured training can enable HCWs to perform CBE. Community awareness is essential for patient compliance and for early-detection, diagnosis, and treatment.

    Title: Autologous patient-derived exhausted nano T-cells exploit tumor immune evasion to engage an effective cancer therapy.

    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Active targeting by surface-modified nanoplatforms enables a more precise and elevated accumulation of nanoparticles within the tumor, thereby enhancing drug delivery and efficacy for a successful cancer treatment. However, surface functionalization involves complex procedures that increase costs and timelines, presenting challenges for clinical implementation. Biomimetic nanoparticles (BNPs) have emerged as unique drug delivery platforms that overcome the limitations of actively targeted nanoparticles. Nevertheless, BNPs coated with unmodified cells show reduced functionalities such as specific tumor targeting, decreasing the therapeutic efficacy. Those challenges can be overcome by engineering non-patient-derived cells for BNP coating, but these are complex and cost-effective approaches that hinder their wider clinical application. Here we present an immune-driven strategy to improve nanotherapeutic delivery to tumors. Our unique perspective harnesses T-cell exhaustion and tumor immune evasion to develop a groundbreaking new class of BNPs crafted from exhausted T-cells (NExT) of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients by specific culture methods without sophisticated engineering. METHODS: NExT were generated by coating PLGA (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)) nanoparticles with TNBC-derived T-cells exhausted in vitro by acute activation. Physicochemical characterization of NExT was made by dynamic light scattering, electrophoretic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy, and preservation and orientation of immune checkpoint receptors by flow cytometry. The efficacy of chemotherapy-loaded NExT was assessed in TNBC cell lines in vitro. In vivo toxicity was made in CD1 mice. Biodistribution and therapeutic activity of NExT were determined in cell-line- and autologous patient-derived xenografts in immunodeficient mice. RESULTS: We report a cost-effective approach with a good performance that provides NExT naturally endowed with immune checkpoint receptors (PD1, LAG3, TIM3), augmenting specific tumor targeting by engaging cognate ligands, enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapy, and disrupting the PD1/PDL1 axis in an immunotherapy-like way. Autologous patient-derived NExT revealed exceptional intratumor accumulation, heightened chemotherapeutic index and efficiency, and targeted the tumor stroma in a PDL1(+) patient-derived xenograft model of triple-negative breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: These advantages underline the potential of autologous patient-derived NExT to revolutionize tailored adoptive cancer nanotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy, which endorses their widespread clinical application of autologous patient-derived NExT.

    Title: Multiomics-based molecular subtyping based on the commensal microbiome predicts molecular characteristics and the therapeutic response in breast cancer.
    Authors: Qin W, Li J, Gao N, Kong X, Guo L, Chen Y, Huang L, Chen X, Qi F
    Abstract: The gut microbiota has been demonstrated to be correlated with the clinical phenotypes of diseases, including cancers. However, there are few studies on clinical subtyping based on the gut microbiota, especially in breast cancer (BC) patients. Here, using machine learning methods, we analysed the gut microbiota of BC, colorectal cancer (CRC), and gastric cancer (GC) patients to identify their shared metabolic pathways and the importance of these pathways in cancer development. Based on the gut microbiota-related metabolic pathways, human gene expression profile and patient prognosis, we established a novel BC subtyping system and identified a subtype called "challenging BC". Tumours with this subtype have more genetic mutations and a more complex immune environment than those of other subtypes. A score index was proposed for in-depth analysis and showed a significant negative correlation with patient prognosis. Notably, activation of the TPK1-FOXP3-mediated Hedgehog signalling pathway and TPK1-ITGAE-mediated mTOR signalling pathway was linked to poor prognosis in "challenging BC" patients with high scores, as validated in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. Furthermore, our subtyping system and score index are effective predictors of the response to current neoadjuvant therapy regimens, with the score index significantly negatively correlated with both treatment efficacy and the number of immune cells. Therefore, our findings provide valuable insights into predicting molecular characteristics and treatment responses in "challenging BC" patients.

    Title: General practitioners' management of mastitis in breastfeeding women: a mixed method study in Australia.
    Authors: Amir LH, Crawford SB, Cullinane M, Grzeskowiak LE
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Mastitis is a common reason new mothers visit their general practitioner (GP). In Australia, the Therapeutic Guidelines: Antibiotic provides practical advice to GPs managing a range of infections, including mastitis. It is not known if Australian GPs prescribe antibiotics and order investigations as recommended for the management of mastitis. METHODS: A convergent mixed methods design integrated quantitative analysis of a general practice dataset with analysis of interviews with GPs. Using the large-scale primary care dataset, MedicineInsight, (2021-2022), antibiotics prescribed and investigations ordered for mastitis encounters were extracted. Mastitis encounters were identified by searching 'Encounter reason', 'Test reason' and 'Prescription reason' free text field for the term 'mastitis'; 'granulomatous mastitis' was excluded. Clinical encounters for mastitis occurring within 14 days of a previous mastitis encounter were defined as belonging to the same treatment episode. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 Australian GPs using Zoom or telephone in 2021-2022, and analysed thematically. The Pillar Integration Process was used to develop a joint display table; qualitative codes and themes were matched with the quantitative items to illustrate similarities/contrasts in findings. RESULTS: During an encounter for mastitis, 3122 (91.7%) women received a prescription for an oral antibiotic; most commonly di/flucloxacillin ([59.4%]) or cefalexin (937 [27.5%]). Investigations recorded ultrasound in 303 (8.9%), blood tests (full blood examination [FBE]: 170 [5.0%]; C-reactive protein [CRP]: 71 [2.1%]; erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]: 34 [1.0%]) and breast milk or nipple swab cultures in approximately 1% of encounters. Analysis using pillar integration showed consistency between quantitative and qualitative data regarding mastitis management. The following themes were identified: - GPs support continued breastfeeding. - Antibiotics are central to GPs' management. - Antibiotics are mostly prescribed according to Therapeutic Guidelines. - Analgesia is a gap in the Therapeutic Guidelines. - Low use of breast milk culture. CONCLUSIONS: Prescribing antibiotics for mastitis remains central to Australian GPs' management of mastitis. Interview data clarified that GPs were aware that antibiotics might not be needed in all cases of mastitis and that delayed prescribing was not uncommon. Overall, GPs followed principles of antibiotic stewardship, however there is a need to train GPs about when to consider ordering investigations.

    Title: Clinical features of patients with carcinoma soft tissue metastases as surgical indications: a retrospective cohort study.
    Authors: Morinaga S, Yamamoto N, Hayashi K, Takeuchi A, Miwa S, Igarashi K, Taniguchi Y, Asano Y, Nojima T, Tsuchiya H
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Soft-tissue metastasis of carcinoma is rare. In the present study, we investigated the surgical indications and clinical features of patients with soft tissue metastases of carcinoma. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled 26 patients with soft tissue carcinoma metastasis referred to our department for treatment. Sex, age, location, size, depth, pain due to the tumor, primary origin, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level, MRI examinations, diagnosis by a previous physician, carcinoma markers from blood, history of carcinoma, other metastases, performance status (PS), and surgical procedures were documented. Associations between variables and surgery were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The primary cancer origin was found to be the lung (n = 10), kidney (n = 7), esophagus (n = 2), stomach (n = 1), breast (n = 1), liver (n = 1), ureter (n = 1), anus (n = 1), and unknown (n = 2). The mean CRP level of all patients was 2.3 mg/dL. Seven tumors (26.9%) were originally suspected to be soft tissue metastases of carcinoma, while 19 tumors (73.1%) were considered soft tissue sarcomas or inflammatory lesions by the previous treating physician. Twenty patients (76.9%) had other metastases. The PS of the 12 patients (46.2%) was zero. Eleven patients (42.3%) underwent surgery for soft tissue metastases. Diagnosis of soft tissue metastasis by a previous physician and good PS (p < 0.05) were significantly associated with surgery. CONCLUSION: Overall, the present results show that surgical indications for soft tissue metastasis of carcinoma include diagnosis by the referring physician or good PS of the patients.

    Title: Effect of immediate initiation of invasive ventilation on mortality in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure: a target trial emulation.
    Authors: Mellado-Artigas R, Borrat X, Ferreyro BL, Yarnell C, Hao S, Wanis KN, Barbeta E, Torres A, Ferrando C, Brochard L
    Abstract: PURPOSE: Invasive ventilation is a fundamental treatment in intensive care but its precise timing is difficult to determine. This study aims at assessing the effect of initiating invasive ventilation versus waiting, in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure without immediate reason for intubation on one-year mortality. METHODS: Emulation of a target trial to estimate the benefit of immediately initiating invasive ventilation in hypoxemic respiratory failure, versus waiting, among patients within the first 48-h of hypoxemia. The eligible population included non-intubated patients with SpO(2)/FiO(2) </= 200 and SpO(2) </= 97%. The target trial was emulated using a single-center database (MIMIC-IV) which contains granular information about clinical status. The hourly probability to receive mechanical ventilation was continuously estimated. The hazard ratios for the primary outcome, one-year mortality, and the secondary outcome, 30-day mortality, were estimated using weighted Cox models with stabilized inverse probability weights used to adjust for measured confounding. RESULTS: 2996 Patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria of whom 792 were intubated within 48 h. Among the non-invasive support devices, the use of oxygen through facemask was the most common (75%). Compared to patients with the same probability of intubation but who were not intubated, intubation decreased the hazard of dying for the first year after ICU admission HR 0.81 (95% CI 0.68-0.96, p = 0.018). Intubation was associated with a 30-day mortality HR of 0.80 (95% CI 0.64-0.99, p = 0.046). CONCLUSION: The initiation of mechanical ventilation in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure reduced the hazard of dying in this emulation of a target trial.

    Title: Breast cancer diagnosis using support vector machine optimized by improved quantum inspired grey wolf optimization.
    Authors: Bilal A, Imran A, Baig TI, Liu X, Abouel Nasr E, Long H
    Abstract: A prompt diagnosis of breast cancer in its earliest phases is necessary for effective treatment. While Computer-Aided Diagnosis systems play a crucial role in automated mammography image processing, interpretation, grading, and early detection of breast cancer, existing approaches face limitations in achieving optimal accuracy. This study addresses these limitations by hybridizing the improved quantum-inspired binary Grey Wolf Optimizer with the Support Vector Machines Radial Basis Function Kernel. This hybrid approach aims to enhance the accuracy of breast cancer classification by determining the optimal Support Vector Machine parameters. The motivation for this hybridization lies in the need for improved classification performance compared to existing optimizers such as Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithm. Evaluate the efficacy of the proposed IQI-BGWO-SVM approach on the MIAS dataset, considering various metric parameters, including accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Furthermore, the application of IQI-BGWO-SVM for feature selection will be explored, and the results will be compared. Experimental findings demonstrate that the suggested IQI-BGWO-SVM technique outperforms state-of-the-art classification methods on the MIAS dataset, with a resulting mean accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 99.25%, 98.96%, and 100%, respectively, using a tenfold cross-validation datasets partition.

    Title: Iterative Development of an Interactive Website to Support Shared Decision-Making in Metastatic Breast Cancer.
    Authors: Conley CC, Cumbo S, Chavez Ochoa J, Boles A, Rodriguez JD, Schwab N, Farrell D, Abduljawad S, Isaacs C, O'Neill SC
    Abstract: Recent treatment advances have resulted in significantly increased survival times following metastatic breast cancer (MBC) diagnosis. Novel treatment approaches-and their related side effects-have changed the landscape of MBC treatment decision-making. We developed a prototype of an online educational tool to prepare patients with MBC for shared decision-making with their oncologists. We describe the five phases of tool development: (1) in-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews and (2) feedback on storyboards of initial content with patients with MBC and oncology providers. This was followed by three phases of iterative feedback with patients in which they responded to (3) initial, non-navigable website content and (4) a beta version of the full website. In the final phase (5), patients newly diagnosed with MBC (N = 6) used the website prototype for 1 week and completed surveys assessing acceptability, feasibility, treatment knowledge, preparation for decision-making, and self-efficacy for decision-making. Participants in Phase 1 characterized a cyclical process of MBC treatment decision-making and identified key information needs. Website content and structure was iteratively developed in Phases 2-4. Most participants in Phase 5 (n = 4) accessed the website 2-5 times. All participants who accessed the website at least once (n = 5) felt they learned new information from the website prototype and would recommend it to others newly-diagnosed with MBC. After using the website prototype, participants reported high preparation and self-efficacy for decision-making. This multiphase, iterative process resulted in a prototype intervention designed to support decision-making for MBC patients.

    Title: Radiolabelling and preclinical characterisation of [(89)Zr]Zr-Df-ATG-101 bispecific to PD-L1/4-1BB.
    Authors: Cao Z, Wichmann CW, Burvenich IJG, Osellame LD, Guo N, Rigopoulos A, O'Keefe GJ, Scott FE, Lorensuhewa N, Lynch KP, Scott AM
    Abstract: PURPOSE: ATG-101, a bispecific antibody that simultaneously targets the immune checkpoint PD-L1 and the costimulatory receptor 4-1BB, activates exhausted T cells upon PD-L1 crosslinking. Previous studies demonstrated promising anti-tumour efficacy of ATG-101 in preclinical models. Here, we labelled ATG-101 with (89)Zr to confirm its tumour targeting effect and tissue biodistribution in a preclinical model. We also evaluated the use of immuno-PET to study tumour uptake of ATG-101 in vivo. METHODS: ATG-101, anti-PD-L1, and an isotype control were conjugated with p-SCN-Deferoxamine (Df). The Df-conjugated antibodies were radiolabelled with (89)Zr, and their radiochemical purity, immunoreactivity, and serum stability were assessed. We conducted PET/MRI and biodistribution studies on [(89)Zr]Zr-Df-ATG-101 in BALB/c nude mice bearing PD-L1-expressing MDA-MB-231 breast cancer xenografts for up to 10 days after intravenous administration of [(89)Zr]Zr-labelled antibodies. The specificity of [(89)Zr]Zr-Df-ATG-101 was evaluated through a competition study with unlabelled ATG-101 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies. RESULTS: The Df-conjugation and [(89)Zr]Zr -radiolabelling did not affect the target binding of ATG-101. Biodistribution and imaging studies demonstrated biological similarity of [(89)Zr]Zr-Df-ATG-101 and [(89)Zr]Zr-Df-anti-PD-L1. Tumour uptake of [(89)Zr]Zr-Df-ATG-101 was clearly visualised using small-animal PET imaging up to 7 days post-injection. Competition studies confirmed the specificity of PD-L1 targeting in vivo. CONCLUSION: [(89)Zr]Zr-Df-ATG-101 in vivo distribution is dependent on PD-L1 expression in the MDA-MB-231 xenograft model. Immuno-PET with [(89)Zr]Zr-Df-ATG-101 provides real-time information about ATG-101 distribution and tumour uptake in vivo. Our data support the use of [(89)Zr]Zr-Df-ATG-101 to assess tumour and tissue uptake of ATG-101.

    Title: Lessons learned from COVID-19: improving breast cancer care post-pandemic from the patient perspective.
    Authors: Myers C, Bennett K, Cahir C
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Since the onset of the pandemic, breast cancer (BC) services have been disrupted in most countries. The purpose of this qualitative study is to explore the unmet needs, patient-priorities, and recommendations for improving BC healthcare post-pandemic for women with BC and to understand how they may vary based on social determinants of health (SDH), in particular socio-economic status (SES). METHODS: Thirty-seven women, who were purposively sampled based on SDH and previously interviewed about the impact of COVID-19 on BC, were invited to take part in follow-up semi-structured qualitative interviews in early 2023. The interviews explored their perspectives of BC care since the easing of COVID-19 government restrictions, including unmet needs, patient-priorities, and recommendations specific to BC care. Thematic analysis was conducted to synthesize each topic narratively with corresponding sub-themes. Additionally, variation by SDH was analyzed within each sub-theme. RESULTS: Twenty-eight women (mean age = 61.7 years, standard deviation (SD) = 12.3) participated in interviews (response rate = 76%). Thirty-nine percent (n = 11) of women were categorized as high-SES, while 61% (n = 17) of women were categorized as low-SES. Women expressed unmet needs in their BC care including routine care and mental and physical well-being care, as well as a lack of financial support to access BC care. Patient priorities included the following: developing cohesion between different aspects of BC care; communication with and between healthcare professionals; and patient empowerment within BC care. Recommendations moving forward post-pandemic included improving the transition from active to post-treatment, enhancing support resources, and implementing telemedicine where appropriate. Overall, women of low-SES experienced more severe unmet needs, which in turn resulted in varied patient priorities and recommendations. CONCLUSION: As health systems are recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, the emphasis should be on restoring access to BC care and improving the quality of BC care, with a particular consideration given to those women from low-SES, to reduce health inequalities post-pandemic.

    Title: Research progress on morphology and mechanism of programmed cell death.
    Authors: Chen Y, Li X, Yang M, Liu SB
    Abstract: Programmed cell death (PCD) is a basic process of life that is closely related to the growth, development, aging and disease of organisms and is one of the hotspots of life science research today. PCD is a kind of genetic control, autonomous and orderly important cell death that involves the activation, expression, and regulation of a series of genes. In recent years, with the deepening of research in this field, new mechanisms of multiple PCD pathways have been revealed. This article reviews and summarizes the multiple PCD pathways that have been discovered, analyses and compares the morphological characteristics and biomarkers of different types of PCD, and briefly discusses the role of various types of PCD in the diagnosis and treatment of different diseases, especially malignant tumors.

    Title: Female Sexual Function Index Adaptation for Breast Cancer Patients (FSFI-BC): Brazilian Portuguese Translation and Cultural Adaptation.
    Authors: Goncalves ACN, Amorim RB, Domingues BS, Sousa JVA, Veiga DF
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: The assessment of female sexual function after diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer is relevant, as cancer can negatively affect sexuality and, therefore, quality of life. Instruments assessing female sexuality can be useful in clinical practice. However, there are few validated instruments available for this purpose. This study aimed to translate the Female Sexual Function Index Adaptation for Breast Cancer Patients (FSFI-BC) into Brazilian Portuguese and culturally adapt it for use in Brazil. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Translation and cross-cultural adaptation followed the linguistic validation process, according to international guidelines. The instrument was translated and back-translated by independent translators. Sixty women aged 25 to 70 years who had been diagnosed and surgically treated for breast cancer at least 6 months previously participated in the cultural adaptation process. Participants were stratified into sexually active or inactive. Internal consistency was analyzed using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. RESULTS: Mean participant age was 52.5 years. For sexually active women, reliability analysis (Cronbach's alpha) showed excellent internal consistency between the items of the subscales 'Desire/Arousal' (alpha = 0.912) and 'Orgasm' (alpha = 0.904), and good internal consistency for 'Lubrication' (alpha = 0.814) and 'Pain' (alpha = 0.839). For sexually inactive women, excellent internal consistency was observed between the items of the subscale 'Reason for Inactivity - difficulty lubricating' (alpha = 0.930), and good internal consistency for the other subscales. The instrument had face and content validity. CONCLUSIONS: FSFI-BC was translated and culturally adapted to the context of the Brazilian population.

    Title: Effectiveness and Safety of Pyrotinib-Based Therapy in the Treatment of HER2-Positive Breast Cancer Patients with Brain Metastases: A Multicenter Real-World Study.
    Authors: Huang J, Sun S, Tan Q, Zheng F, Zhou D, Man X, Hu Y, Li W, Song L, Zhang B, Xu L, Wang X, Xie X, Li H
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Approximately 30% to 50% of patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive metastatic breast cancer develop brain metastasis (BMs). Pyrotinib has shown promising efficacy in these patients. However, real-world evidence supporting its use is scarce. Therefore, we evaluate the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib-based regimens in the real world. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled patients with BMs from various healthcare facilities in China's Shandong region and used an updated breast-graded prognostic assessment (breast-GPA) to predict survival outcomes. RESULTS: Efficacy and toxicity were assessed in 101 patients. Overall, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 11.0 months (95% CI, 7.6-14.4 months). PFS was shorter in patients with a breast-GPA of 0 to 2.0 (P< .001). Previous treatment with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab (P = .039) and varying numbers of BMs (P = .028) had a significant positive correlation with PFS. Additionally, radiotherapy (P = .033) for BMs, especially pyrotinib concurrent with radiotherapy (P = .013), significantly prolonged the PFS. In patients with a breast-GPA of 0 to 2.0, a significant difference in PFS was observed depending on whether the brain was the first metastatic site (P< .001). Furthermore, a breast-GPA (0-2.0 vs. 2.5-4.0), and radiotherapy for BMs were found to be independent predictors of PFS. Overall, the objective response rate was 42.6%, while the disease control rate was 88.1%. Diarrhea emerged as the most common adverse event. CONCLUSION: Pyrotinib-based therapy is effective and tolerable in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive metastatic breast cancer with BMs. Patients who underwent radiotherapy for BMs, particularly those who received pyrotinib concurrently with radiotherapy, exhibited a more favorable prognosis.

    Title: A Phase 1 dose escalation and expansion trial of the next-generation oral SERD camizestrant in women with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer: SERENA-1 monotherapy results.
    Authors: Hamilton E, Oliveira M, Turner N, Garcia-Corbacho J, Hernando C, Ciruelos EM, Kabos P, Borrego MR, Armstrong A, Patel MR, Vaklavas C, Twelves C, Boni V, Incorvati J, Brier T, Gibbons L, Klinowska T, Lindemann JPO, Morrow CJ, Sykes A, Baird R
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: SERENA-1 (NCT03616587) is a Phase 1, multi-part, open-label study of camizestrant in pre- and post-menopausal women with ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer. Parts A and B aim to determine the safety and tolerability of camizestrant monotherapy and define doses for clinical evaluation. Patients and Methods Women aged 18 years or older with metastatic or recurrent ER+, HER2- breast cancer, refractory (or intolerant) to therapy were assigned 25 mg up to 450 mg once daily (QD; escalation) or 75, 150, or 300 mg QD (expansion). Safety and tolerability, anti-tumor efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and impact on ESR1m circulating tumor (ct)DNA levels were assessed. RESULTS: By 9 March 2021, 108 patients received camizestrant monotherapy at 25-450 mg doses. Of these, 93 (86.1%) experienced treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), 82.4% of which were grade 1 or 2. The most common TRAEs were visual effects (56%), (sinus) bradycardia (44%), fatigue (26%), and nausea (15%). There were no TRAEs grade 3 or higher, or treatment-related serious adverse events (TRSAEs) at doses </=150 mg. Median t(max) was achieved  approximately 2-4 hours post-dose at all doses investigated, with an estimated half-life of 20-23 hours. Efficacy was observed at all doses investigated, including in patients with prior CDK4/6 inhibitor and/or fulvestrant treatment, with and without baseline ESR1 mutations, and with visceral disease, including liver metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Camizestrant is a next-generation oral SERD and pure ER antagonist with a tolerable safety profile. The pharmacokinetics profile supports once-daily dosing, with evidence of pharmacodynamic and clinical efficacy in heavily pre-treated patients, regardless of ESR1m. This study established 75, 150 and 300 mg QD doses for Phase 2 testing (SERENA-2, NCT04214288 and SERENA-3, NCT04588298).

    Abstract: BACKGROUND: In MONARCH 2, the addition of abemaciclib to fulvestrant significantly improved both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer (ABC) with disease progression on prior endocrine therapy (ET). In MONARCH 3, the addition of abemaciclib to a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) as initial therapy for HR+, HER2- ABC significantly improved PFS. Here, we present the prespecified final OS results for MONARCH 3. PATIENTS AND METHODS: MONARCH 3 is a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study of abemaciclib plus NSAI (anastrozole or letrozole) versus placebo plus NSAI in postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- ABC without prior systemic therapy in the advanced setting. The primary objective was investigator-assessed PFS; OS was a gated secondary endpoint, and chemotherapy-free survival (CFS) was an exploratory endpoint. RESULTS: A total of 493 women were randomized 2:1 to receive abemaciclib plus NSAI (n = 328) or placebo plus NSAI (n = 165). After a median follow-up of 8.1 years, there were 198 OS events (60.4%) in the abemaciclib arm and 116 (70.3%) in the placebo arm (hazard ratio, 0.804; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.637-1.015; P = 0.0664, non-significant). Median OS was 66.8 versus 53.7 months for abemaciclib versus placebo. In the subgroup with visceral disease (sVD), there were 113 OS events (65.3%) in the abemaciclib arm and 65 (72.2%) in the placebo arm (hazard ratio, 0.758; 95% CI, 0.558-1.030; P = 0.0757, non-significant). Median OS was 63.7 months versus 48.8 months for abemaciclib versus placebo. The previously demonstrated PFS benefit was sustained, and CFS numerically improved with the addition of abemaciclib. No new safety signals were observed. CONCLUSION: Abemaciclib combined with an NSAI resulted in clinically meaningful improvement in median OS (ITT: 13.1 months; sVD: 14.9 months) in patients with HR+ HER2- ABC; however, statistical significance was not reached.

    Title: MICAL-L2, as an estrogen-responsive gene, is involved in ER-positive breast cancer cell progression and tamoxifen sensitivity via the AKT/mTOR pathway.
    Authors: Wen P, Li J, Wen Z, Guo X, Ma G, Hu S, Xu J, Zhao H, Li R, Liu Y, Wang Y, Gao J
    Abstract: Endocrine treatment, particularly tamoxifen, has shown significant improvement in the prognosis of patients with estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive) breast cancer. However, the clinical utility of this treatment is often hindered by the development of endocrine resistance. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving ER-positive breast cancer carcinogenesis and endocrine resistance is crucial to overcome this clinical challenge. In this study, we investigated the expression of MICAL-L2 in ER-positive breast cancer and its impact on patient prognosis. We observed a significant upregulation of MICAL-L2 expression in ER-positive breast cancer, which correlated with a poorer prognosis in these patients. Furthermore, we found that estrogen-ERbeta signaling promoted the expression of MICAL-L2. Functionally, our study demonstrated that MICAL-L2 not only played an oncogenic role in ER-positive breast cancer tumorigenesis but also influenced the sensitivity of ER-positive breast cancer cells to tamoxifen. Mechanistically, as an estrogen-responsive gene, MICAL-L2 facilitated the activation of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in ER-positive breast cancer cells. Collectively, our findings suggest that MICAL-L2 could serve as a potential prognostic marker for ER-positive breast cancer and represent a promising molecular target for improving endocrine treatment and developing therapeutic approaches for this subtype of breast cancer.

    Title: Immunotherapies for locally aggressive cancers.
    Authors: Adams SC, Nambiar AK, Bressler EM, Raut CP, Colson YL, Wong WW, Grinstaff MW
    Abstract: Improving surgical resection outcomes for locally aggressive tumors is key to inducing durable locoregional disease control and preventing progression to metastatic disease. Macroscopically complete resection of the tumor is the standard of care for many cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, sarcoma, and mesothelioma. Advancements in cancer diagnostics are increasing the number of surgically eligible cases through early detection. Thus, a unique opportunity arises to improve patient outcomes with decreased recurrence rates via intraoperative delivery treatments using local drug delivery strategies after the tumor has been resected. Of the current systemic treatments (e.g., chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and immunotherapies), immunotherapies are the latest approach to offer significant benefits. Intraoperative strategies benefit from direct access to the tumor microenvironment which improves drug uptake to the tumor and simultaneously minimizes the risk of drug entering healthy tissues thereby resulting in fewer or less toxic adverse events. We review the current state of immunotherapy development and discuss the opportunities that intraoperative treatment provides. We conclude by summarizing progress in current research, identifying areas for exploration, and discussing future prospects in sustained remission.

    Title: A radiation therapy contouring atlas for delineation of the level I-II axilla in the prone position: a single institution experience.
    Authors: Purswani JM, Goldberg E, Cahlon O, Schnabel F, Axelrod D, Guth A, Perez CA, Shaikh F, Tam M, Formenti S, Reig B, Gerber NK
    Abstract: PURPOSE: With transition from supine to prone, tenting of the pectoralis major occurs displacing the muscle from the chest wall and shifting the level I-II axillary spaces. For patients whom we aim to treat the level I-II axilla using the prone technique, accurate delineation of these nodal regions is necessary. While different consensus guidelines exist for delineation of nodal anatomy supine, to our knowledge there are no contouring guidelines in the prone position that account for this change in nodal anatomy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The level I-II nodal contours from the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) breast cancer supine atlas were adapted for prone position by two radiation oncologists and a breast radiologist based on anatomic changes observed from supine to prone positioning on preoperative diagnostic imaging. Forty-three patients from a single institution treated with prone high tangents from 2012 to 2018 were identified as representative cases to delineate the revised level I-II axilla on non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scans obtained during radiation simulation. The revised nodal contours were reviewed by an expanded expert multidisciplinary panel including breast radiologists, radiation oncologists, and surgical oncologists for consistency and reproducibility. RESULTS: Consensus was achieved among the panel in order to create modifications from the RTOG breast atlas for CT-based contouring of the level I-II axilla prone using bone, muscle and skin as landmarks. This atlas provides representative examples and accompanying descriptions for the changes described to the caudal and anterior border of level II, and the anterior, posterior, medial and lateral border of level I. A step-by-step guide is provided for properly identifying the revised anterior border of the level I axilla. CONCLUSIONS: The adaptations to the RTOG breast cancer atlas for prone positioning will enable radiation oncologists to more accurately target the level I-II axilla when the axilla is a target in addition to the breast.

    Title: Unlocking the adaptive advantage: correlation and machine learning classification to identify optimal online adaptive stereotactic partial breast candidates.
    Authors: Pogue JA, Harms JM, Cardenas CE, Ray X, Viscariello N, Popple RA, Stanley D, Boggs DH
    Abstract: Online adaptive radiotherapy (OART) is a promising technique for delivering stereotactic accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI), as lumpectomy cavities vary in location and size between simulation and treatment. However, OART is resource-intensive, increasing planning and treatment times and decreasing machine throughput compared to the standard of care (SOC). Thus, it is pertinent to identify high-yield OART candidates to best allocate resources. &#xD;Approach. Reference plans (plans based on simulation anatomy), SOC plans (reference plans recalculated onto daily anatomy), and daily adaptive plans were analyzed for 31 sequential APBI targets, resulting in the analysis of 333 treatment plans. Spearman correlations between 22 reference plan metrics and 10 adaptive benefits, defined as the difference between mean SOC and delivered metrics, were analyzed to select a univariate predictor of OART benefit. A multivariate logistic regression model was then trained to stratify high- and low-benefit candidates.&#xD;Main Results. Adaptively delivered plans showed dosimetric benefit as compared to SOC plans for most plan metrics, although the degree of adaptive benefit varied per patient. The univariate model showed high likelihood for dosimetric adaptive benefit when the reference plan ipsilateral breast V15Gy exceeds 23.5%. Recursive feature elimination identified 5 metrics that predict high-dosimetric-benefit adaptive patients. Using leave-one-out cross validation, the univariate and multivariate models classified targets with 74.2% and 83.9% accuracy, resulting in improvement in per-fraction adaptive benefit between targets identified as high- and low-yield for 7/10 and 8/10 plan metrics, respectively. &#xD;Significance. This retrospective, exploratory study demonstrated that dosimetric benefit can be predicted using only ipsilateral breast V15 Gy on the reference treatment plan, allowing for a simple, interpretable model. Using multivariate logistic regression for adaptive benefit prediction led to increased accuracy at the cost of a more complicated model. This work presents a methodology for clinics wishing to triage OART resource allocation.&#xD.

    Authors: Radhakrishna GK, Ammunje DN, Kunjiappan S, Ravi K, Vellingiri S, Ramesh SH, Almeida SD, Sireesha G, Ramesh S, Al-Qahtani S, Chidamabaram K, Theivendren P, Pavadai P
    Abstract: This study examines the fundamental chemical mechanisms responsible for capsaicin's advantageous impact on cancer, specifically investigating its influence on several biological processes such as inflammation in cancer metastasis, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and cellular proliferation. This entity's connections with other signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, NF-B, and TRPV channels, which have been linked to tumor growth, are thoroughly examined in this work. This study presents a thorough analysis of preclinical studies and clinical trials investigating the efficacy of capsaicin in treating many forms of cancer, such as breast, prostate, colorectal, pancreatic, and others. Through tests conducted in both live organisms and laboratory settings, it has been determined that capsaicin has the ability to inhibit tumor growth and induce apoptosis in cancer cells. (in vitro and in vivo). Researchers have also looked at the results of combining capsaicin with chemotherapy medications in traditional treatment. The efficacy and bioavailability of capsaicin as a viable medicinal drug are being studied, along with ways to improve its clinical value. The present investigation carefully assesses the challenges and potential options for maximizing the therapeutic benefits of capsaicin, including customized drug delivery and personalized therapeutic strategies. In finalization, this comprehensive investigation brings together the evidence currently obtainable on the anticancer properties of capsaicin, underscoring its potential as an autonomous treatment option in the struggle against cancer. Capsaicin is a compound of significant relevance for continuing research and clinical exploration in the field of cancer treatment due to its diverse mechanisms of action and ability for boosting prevailing therapy approaches.

    Title: Inhibition of protein translational machinery in triple-negative breast cancer as a promising therapeutic strategy.
    Authors: Dheeraj A, Garcia Marques FJ, Tailor D, Bermudez A, Resendez A, Pandrala M, Grau B, Kumar P, Haley CB, Honkala A, Kujur P, Jeffrey SS, Pitteri S, Malhotra SV
    Abstract: Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) is a proto-oncogenic protein associated with protein translation regulation. It plays a crucial role in the development and progression of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In this study, we describe a promising approach to inhibit YB-1 using SU056, a small-molecule inhibitor. SU056 physically interacts with YB-1 and reduces its expression, which helps to restrain the progression of TNBC. Proteome profiling analysis indicates that the inhibition of YB-1 by SU056 can alter the proteins that regulate protein translation, an essential process for cancer cell growth. Preclinical studies on human cells, mice, and patient-derived xenograft tumor models show the effectiveness of SU056. Moreover, toxicological studies have shown that SU056 treatment and dosing are well tolerated without any adverse effects. Overall, our study provides a strong foundation for the further development of SU056 as a potential treatment option for patients with TNBC by targeting YB-1.

    Title: Toxicity of immunotherapy combinations with chemotherapy across tumor indications: Current knowledge and practical recommendations.
    Authors: Rached L, Laparra A, Sakkal M, Danlos FX, Barlesi F, Carbonnel F, De Martin E, Ducreux M, Even C, Le Pavec J, Michot JM, M Ribeiro J, Scotte F, Ponce Aix S, Lambotte O, Baldini C, Champiat S
    Abstract: Chemotherapy associated with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors is currently the standard of care in several tumor indications. This combination approach improves progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and complete pathological response (pCR) in several cancer types both in the early and metastatic approaches. However, the distinct spectrum of toxicities between cytotoxic side effects and immune related adverse events (irAEs) with similar clinical presentations and different management strategies remains a challenge in daily practice for healthcare professionals. This review summarizes the most common toxicities reported in the randomized clinical trials that led to the subsequent FDA approval of these combinations, across tumor indications. We cite in particular: non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, triple negative breast cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, gastric carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, cervical carcinoma and biliary tract carcinoma. We found that the combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy was associated with an increased incidence of all grade adverse events (RR 1.11 [1.09; 1.12]) without an excess in treatment related mortality when compared to chemotherapy alone. We report also an increase in the incidence of serious adverse events (grade >/= 3) (RR 1.16 [1.10;1.24]); in particular: high grade diarrhea, dyspnea, fatigue, rash and elevated liver enzymes. Together with the collaboration of our institutional network of organ specialists with expertise in irAEs, we propose practical recommendations for physicians to enhance clinical care and management of patients undergoing treatment with combined ICI immunotherapy and chemotherapy.

    Title: Immediate lymphatic reconstruction: Lessons learned over eight years.
    Authors: Friedman R, Ismail Aly MA, Fanning JE, Pardo JA, Johnson AR, Lee BT, James T, Singhal D
    Abstract: Immediate lymphatic reconstruction (ILR) is recognized as a surgical approach used to reduce the risk of developing secondary lymphedema, and evidence demonstrating the efficacy of ILR is favorable. Our Lymphatic Center has become a centralized location offering ILR for the risk-reduction in breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) in New England. Over the course of our experience, we made several modifications and adapted our approach to enhance the operative success of this procedure. These include advancements in our use of indocyanine green (ICG) imaging to identify baseline lymphatic anatomical variation, utilization of fluorescein isothiocyanate for lymphatic vessel visualization, application of the lymphosome concept to guide arm injection sites, verification of anastomotic patency (using ICG), localization of reconstruction to guide radiation therapy, incorporation of intraoperative tools to facilitate better anatomic visualization of the axilla, and addition of a lower extremity vein graft to mitigate venous-related complications. Collecting information from each surgery in a standardized manner, including intraoperative lymphatic channel measurements, and deploying clips for possible future radiation exposure, enables future studies on ILR patient outcomes. In this contribution, we aimed to share our institutional modifications with the surgical community to facilitate further adoption, conversation, and advancement of ILR for the risk-reduction in BCRL.

    Title: The ERK inhibitor GDC-0994 selectively inhibits growth of BRAF mutant cancer cells.
    Authors: Chen Y, Sang Y, Li S, Xue J, Chen M, Hong S, Lv W, Sehgal K, Xiao H, Liu R
    Abstract: BRAF or RAS mutation-induced aberrant activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is frequently observed in human cancers. As the key downstream node of MAPK pathway, ERK1/2 is as an important therapeutic target. GDC-0994 (ravoxertinib), an orally bioavailable, highly selective small-molecule inhibitor of ERK1/2, showed acceptable safety and pharmacodynamic profile in a recent phase I clinical trial. In this study, we investigated dependence of the anti-tumor effect of ERK inhibitor GDC-0994 on genetic alterations in the MAPK pathway. The results showed that GDC-0994 sharply inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation and induced remarkable G1 phase cell-cycle arrest in cancer cells harboring BRAF mutation but had little effect on cell behaviors in most RAS mutant or wild-type cell lines. The expression of a large number of genes, particularly the genes in the cell cycle pathway, were significantly changed after GDC-0994 treatment in BRAF mutant cells, while no remarkable expression change of such genes was observed in wild-type cells. Moreover, GDC-0994 selectively inhibited tumor growth in a BRAF mutant xenograft mice model. Our findings demonstrate a BRAF mutation-dependent anti-tumor effect of GDC-0994 and provide a rational strategy for patient selection for ERK1/2 inhibitor treatment.

    Title: Psychotropic Medication Prescriptions for Home-Based Palliative Care Oncology Patients.
    Authors: Mohamed F, Uvais NA, Moideen S, Cp RR, Saif M
    Abstract: Objective: To examine the complexities of psychotropic medication prescription in home-based palliative care for oncology patients. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 125 medical records of patients receiving palliative home care for cancer was conducted at a tertiary hospital, with a specific focus on the prescription patterns of psychotropic medications. The data were collected in September 2023. Results: Among 125 cases, the mean age was 64.4 +/- 14.9 years, with 50.4% females. Breast cancer (14.4%) and lung cancer (13.6%) were the most common diagnoses. Psychotropic medication was administered to 35.2% of patients. Treatment was initiated by palliative care doctors in 75% of cases, while psychiatrists handled 25%. Medication selection was predominantly symptom driven (63%), with anxiety prompting benzodiazepine prescriptions in 50% of cases, depression resulting in antidepressant use in 22%, and psychosis leading to antipsychotic treatment in 18%. Specific diagnoses were the target in only 36% of prescriptions, with delirium (27%) being the most prevalent, followed by depression and bipolar disorder. Benzodiazepines were the most commonly prescribed class of medications (56.8%), with clonazepam being the most prevalent (40.9%), followed by alprazolam and lorazepam (15.9%). Atypical antipsychotics made up 43.1% of prescriptions, with quetiapine being the most frequently prescribed (34%), along with olanzapine and risperidone (11%). Antidepressants accounted for 31.8% of prescriptions, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors at 18% and mirtazapine and amitriptyline at 6% each. Haloperidol, a typical antipsychotic, was prescribed in 13.6% of cases. Polypharmacy was observed in 35.6% of patients. Conclusion: In palliative home care, psychotropic medications are frequently prescribed by palliative doctors primarily for symptom management, with limited psychiatric consultations and challenges in accessing psychological evaluations. Collaborative efforts among regional or institutional medical bodies, including psychiatrists, psychologists, palliative doctors, and social workers, are needed to establish ethical guidelines for appropriate and effective psychotropic prescription.

    Title: A beta-Carboline Derivate PAD4 Inhibitor Reshapes Neutrophil Phenotype and Improves the Tumor Immune Microenvironment against Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.
    Authors: Zhu D, Lu Y, Yan Z, Deng Q, Hu B, Wang Y, Wang W, Wang Y, Wang Y
    Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer is a highly aggressive and heterogeneous breast cancer subtype characterized by early metastasis, poor prognosis, and high recurrence. Targeting histone citrullination-mediated chromatin dysregulation to induce epigenetic alterations shows great promise in TNBC therapy. We report the synthesis, optimization, and evaluation of a novel series of beta-carboline-derived peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 inhibitors that exhibited potent inhibition of TNBC cell proliferation. The most outstanding PAD4 inhibitor, compound 28, hindered the PAD4-H3cit-NET signaling pathway and inhibited the growth of solid tumors and pulmonary metastatic nodules in the 4T1 in situ mouse model. Furthermore, 28 improved the tumor immune microenvironment by reshaping neutrophil phenotype, upregulating the proportions of dendritic cells and M1 macrophages, and reducing the amount of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. In conclusion, our work offered 28 as an efficacious PAD4 inhibitor that exerts a combination of conventional chemotherapy and immune-boosting effects, which represents a potential therapy strategy for TNBC.

    Title: Edema of the upper extremity on the unaffected side in unilateral breast cancer patients.
    Authors: Kim JH, Seong ST, Lee JH, Kim GC, Jeong HJ, Sim YJ
    Abstract: Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) occurs usually on the affected side, and its cause and pathophysiology are well known. However, the cause of edema of the upper extremity on the unaffected side is barely known. It is often considered to be chemotherapy-induced general edema, and clinical evaluation is rarely performed in these patients. This study aimed to present the clinical characteristics of unilateral breast cancer patients with edema of upper extremity on the unaffected side, and to emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and medical interventions. This study retrospectively analyzed the medical records of unilateral breast cancer patients complaining edema of upper extremity on the unaffected side, from January 2020 to May 2021. Lymphoscintigraphy was used to assist in confirming the diagnosis of lymphedema, and Doppler ultrasonography or 3D computed tomography angiography were performed to differentiate vascular problems. Fourteen patients were enrolled in the study. Seven, 3, and 4 patients had edema of both upper extremities, edema of the upper extremity on the unaffected side only, and edema of all extremities, respectively. None of the 4 patients with edema of all extremities showed abnormal findings on examination. In patients with edema in the upper extremity on the unaffected side alone, lymphatic flow dysfunction was seen in 2 patients, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was diagnosed in 1. In patients with edema of both upper extremities, lymphatic flow dysfunction was seen in 2 patients, and DVT was diagnosed in 3. One patient had DVT and accompanying lymphatic flow dysfunction. Lymphedema and DVT were diagnosed in a number of patients with edema of the upper extremity on the unaffected side, and lymphedema can occur without direct injury to the lymphatic flow system. Therefore, clinicians should not overlook the fact that diseases that require early diagnosis and treatment can occur in patients with edema of the unaffected upper extremity.

    Title: Identification and validation of a prognostic anoikis-related gene signature in papillary thyroid carcinoma by integrated analysis of single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing.
    Authors: Zheng K, Zhang XX, Yu X, Yu B, Yang YF
    Abstract: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) prognosis may be deteriorated due to the metastases, and anoikis palys an essential role in the tumor metastasis. However, the potential effect of anoikis-related genes on the prognosis of PTC was unclear. The mRNA and clinical information were obtained from the cancer genome atlas database. Hub genes were identified and risk model was constructed using Cox regression analysis. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curve was applied for the survival analysis. Immune infiltration and immune therapy response were calculated using CIBERSORT and TIDE. The identification of cell types and cell interaction was performed by Seurat, SingleR and CellChat packages. GO, KEGG, and GSVA were applied for the enrichment analysis. Protein-protein interaction network was constructed in STRING and Cytoscape. Drug sensitivity was assessed in GSCA. Based on bulk RNA data, we identified 4 anoikis-related risk signatures, which were oncogenes, and constructed a risk model. The enrichment analysis found high risk group was enriched in some immune-related pathways. High risk group had higher infiltration of Tregs, higher TIDE score and lower levels of monocytes and CD8 T cells. Based on scRNA data, we found that 4 hub genes were mainly expressed in monocytes and macrophages, and they interacted with T cells. Hub genes were significantly related to immune escape-related genes. Drug sensitivity analysis suggested that cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A may be a better chemotherapy target. We constructed a risk model which could effectively and steadily predict the prognosis of PTC. We inferred that the immune escape may be involved in the development of PTC.

    Title: Identification of the new molecular subtypes related to inflammation in breast cancer.
    Authors: Yu K, Xu C, Wang F, Wang H
    Abstract: Breast cancer is a prevalent ailment among women, and the inflammatory response plays a crucial role in the management and prediction of breast cancer (BRCA). However, the new subtypes based on inflammation in BRCA research are still undefined. The databases including The Cancer Genome Atlas and gene expression omnibus were utilized to gather clinical data and somatic mutation information for approximately 1069 BRCA patients. Through Consensus Clustering, novel subtypes linked to inflammation were identified. A comparative analysis was conducted on the prognosis, and immune cell infiltration, and somatic mutation of the new subtypes. Additionally, an investigation into drug therapy and immunotherapy was conducted to distinguish high-risk individuals from low-risk ones. The findings of this investigation proposed the categorization of BRCA into innovative subtypes predicated on the inflammatory response and 6 key genes were a meaningful approach. Specifically, the low-, medium-, and high-inflammation subtypes exhibited varying degrees of association with clinicopathological features, tumor microenvironment, and prognosis. Notably, the high-inflammation subtype was characterized by a strong correlation with immunosuppressive microenvironments and a higher frequency of somatic mutations, which was an indication of poorer health. This study revealed that a brand-new classification could throw new light on the effective prognosis. The integration of multiple key genes was a new characterization that could promote more immunotherapy strategies and contribute to predicting the efficacy of the chemotherapeutic drugs.

    Title: Cancer-associated fibroblast-derived gene signature discriminates distinct prognoses by integrated single-cell and bulk RNA-seq analyses in breast cancer.
    Authors: Fang Z, Han YL, Gao ZJ, Yao F
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are one of the most predominant cellular subpopulations in the tumor stroma and play an integral role in cancer occurrence and progression. However, the prognostic role of CAFs in breast cancer remains poorly understood. METHODS: We identified a number of CAF-related biomarkers in breast cancer by combining single-cell and bulk RNA-seq analyses. Based on univariate Cox regression as well as Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analysis, a novel CAF-associated prognostic model was developed. Breast cancer patients were grouped according to the median risk score and further analyzed for outcome, clinical characteristic, pathway activity, genomic feature, immune landscape, and drug sensitivity. RESULTS: A total of 341 CAF-related biomarkers were identified from single-cell and bulk RNA-seq analyses. We eventually screened eight candidate prognostic genes, including CERCAM, EMP1, SDC1, PRKG1, XG, TNN, WLS, and PDLIM4, and constructed the novel CAF-related prognostic model. Grouped by the median risk score, high-risk patients showed a significantly worse prognosis and exhibited distinct pathway activities such as uncontrolled cell cycle progression, angiogenesis, and activation of glycolysis. In addition, the combined risk score and tumor mutation burden significantly improved the ability to predict patient prognosis. Importantly, patients in the high-risk group had a higher infiltration of M2 macrophages and a lower infiltration of CD8(+) T cells and activated NK cells. Finally, we calculated the IC50 for a range of anticancer drugs and personalized the treatment regimen for each patient. CONCLUSION: Integrating single-cell and bulk RNA-seq analyses, we identified a list of compositive CAF-associated biomarkers and developed a novel CAF-related prognostic model for breast cancer. This robust CAF-derived gene signature acts as an excellent predictor of patient outcomes and treatment responses in breast cancer.

    Title: "Hearing the pupils' voices through my own struggles": A qualitative study of return to work among school counselors who are breast cancer survivors.
    Authors: Levkovich I, Rosman L, Signorelli C
    Abstract: For breast cancer survivors, returning to work is an important step for their personal, financial, and psycho-social recovery. Returning to work as a school counselor can be particularly challenging because of the demands of their job and stress at work. This qualitative study examines return to work among school counselors who are breast cancer survivors. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 28 survivors of breast cancer stages I-III between the ages of 32 and 55, and up to ten years after the completion of chemotherapy. Interviews focused on the discovery of the illness, treatment period, ramifications of the diagnosis on various aspects of life, and implications for work. Using thematic analysis of the data collected, analysis of the findings revealed three key themes: 1) "Everyone is replaceable": The significance of disruptions in work continuity for school counselors who are breast cancer survivors. 2) "From Zero to a Hundred": Challenges Faced by Counselors in Returning to Work after Breast Cancer Recovery.3) "It's hard to listen to counselees' problems when I am immersed in my own crisis": How surviving breast cancer affects return to work among school counselors. Findings highlight the unique needs of these counselors and the challenges they face upon returning to work. The study discusses recommendations for school principals including training, advocacy, and awareness to support survivors and improve their return to work.

    Title: Effects of CD44 siRNA on inhibition, survival, and apoptosis of breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and 4T1).
    Authors: Dehbokri SG, Noorolyai S, Baghbani E, Moghaddamneshat N, Javaheri T, Baradaran B
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers in the world. Despite the many advances that have been made in treating patients, many patients are still resistant to treatment. CD44 is one of the surface glycoproteins of BC cells that plays an important role in the proliferation of these cells and inhibition of their apoptosis. Therefore, targeting it can be a treatment way for BC patients. METHODS: In this study, the effect of anti-CD44 siRNA on the proliferation, apoptosis, and migration rate of MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells was investigated. The techniques used in this study were MTT assay, RT-PCR, and flow cytometry. RESULTS: The apoptosis and proliferation rates in CD44 siRNA-treated cells were higher and lower, respectively, compared to untreated cells. Also, cell migration was less in treated cells compared to untreated cells. CD44 siRNA also decreased the expression of CXCR4, c-myc, Vimentin, ROCK, and MMP-9. CONCLUSION: Finally, CD44 targeting can be a good treatment option to make BC cells more sensitive to apoptosis.

    Title: Do we need reshape rTNM staging system for ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence of breast cancer? A population-based, propensity score matched cohort study.
    Authors: Zhang S, Yang H, Xu Y, Wang S
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to explore the role of recurrent TNM (rTNM) staging in predicting prognosis for ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) and determine the optimal treatment strategy for IBTR. METHOD: IBTR cases were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database spanning the years 2000-2018. Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to examine factors associated with overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS). Propensity score matching (PSM) was employed to match IBTR with primary early breast cancer (EBC) based on clinicopathological characteristics. Investigations into the impact of different therapies were also included. RESULTS: Of the 4375 IBTR cases included in the study, the 5-year OS was 87.1%, 71.6% and 58.7% in rTNM stages I, II and III, respectively. After PSM, while IBTR patients had worse survival to primary EBC patients, prognosis of IBTR for different rTNM stage always closely aligned with the corresponding stage of primary EBC. Repeat breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with radiation therapy was equivalent to mastectomy with respect to OS and BCSS. Chemotherapy was favorable for OS and BCSS in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative IBTR or IBTR occurring within a 60-month interval. CONCLUSIONS: rTNM staging system has an outstanding prognostic value for survival outcome of patients with IBTR, and IBTR and primary EBC may have potentially analogous features in the context of TNM staging. BCS plus radiation therapy may be an alternative. IBTR cases who have experienced recurrence with short intervals and with ER-negative tumors might benefit from chemotherapy.

    Title: Breast Cancer Immune Landscape: Interplay Between Systemic and Local Immunity.
    Authors: Gerashchenko T, Frolova A, Patysheva M, Fedorov A, Stakheyeva M, Denisov E, Cherdyntseva N
    Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common malignancies in women worldwide. Numerous studies in immuno-oncology and successful trials of immunotherapy have demonstrated the causal role of the immune system in cancer pathogenesis. The interaction between the tumor and the immune system is known to have a dual nature. Despite cytotoxic lymphocyte activity against transformed cells, a tumor can escape immune surveillance and leverage chronic inflammation to maintain its own development. Research on antitumor immunity primarily focuses on the role of the tumor microenvironment, whereas the systemic immune response beyond the tumor site is described less thoroughly. Here, a comprehensive review of the formation of the immune profile in breast cancer patients is offered. The interplay between systemic and local immune reactions as self-sustaining mechanism of tumor progression is described and the functional activity of the main cell populations related to innate and adaptive immunity is discussed. Additionally, the interaction between different functional levels of the immune system and their contribution to the development of the pro- or anti-tumor immune response in BC is highlighted. The presented data can potentially inform the development of new immunotherapy strategies in the treatment of patients with BC.

    Title: Psychosocial and supportive care concerns of young women living with advanced breast cancer: baseline findings from a prospective virtual support intervention study.
    Authors: Dibble KE, Rosenberg SM, Zheng Y, Sella T, Poorvu P, Snow C, Darai S, Rene C, Mack JW, Partridge AH
    Abstract: PURPOSE: Adolescent and young adults (AYAs) with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) experience high physical and psychosocial burdens compounded by a disrupted life trajectory. We sought to determine the psychosocial and supportive care concerns of this population to better understand and address unmet needs. METHODS: AYAs diagnosed with MBC (18-39 years) participating in a prospective interventional study (Young, Empowered, and Strong) at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute completed an electronic survey following enrollment. Measures evaluated sociodemographics, health behaviors, quality of life, and symptoms, among others. We used two-sided Fisher's exact tests to determine associations between concerns (e.g., cancer progression, side effects, lifestyle, finances, fertility) and demographic variables. RESULTS: Among 77 participants enrolled from 9/2020-12/2022, average age at MBC diagnosis and survey was 35.9 (range: 22-39) and 38.3 years (range: 27-46), respectively. Most were non-Hispanic white (83.8%) and 40.3% reported their diagnosis caused some financial problems. Many were concerned about fertility (27.0%), long-term treatment side effects (67.6%), exercise (61.6%), and diet (54.1%). Select concerns varied significantly by age, race/ethnicity, and education. Younger women at survey reported greater concern about familial cancer risk (p = 0.028). Women from minority racial/ethnic groups more frequently reported issues talking about their cancer to family/friends (p = 0.040) while those with more education were more frequently concerned with long-term effects of cancer on their health (p = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Young women living with MBC frequently report psychosocial, health, and cancer management concerns. Tailoring supportive care and communications to address prevalent concerns including disease progression and treatment side effects may optimize wellbeing.

    Authors: Singh N, Hayat S, Kumar S, Chowdhury Z, Dhal I, Patne SC, Kadali K, Mishra BK, Kapoor A, Gupta A, Singh A, Sansar B
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Breast lymphomas are a rare group of malignancies that are further subdivided into primary and secondary. AIMS: To study the pathological and clinical course of breast lymphomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of patients treated at our institute over a period of 4.5 years from September 2018 to February 2023. The details of all the patients diagnosed with breast lymphoma were reviewed and analysed for the histomorphological, immunohistochemical, clinical, and treatment details. Appropriate statistical analysis including Kaplan-Meier methods was used. RESULTS: Out of 11 cases of breast lymphoma, five were primary and six were secondary. It was seen predominantly in females (82%) and the age range was 31 to 73 years. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was the predominant morphology (73%), along with single rare cases of ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and small lymphocytic lymphoma. The treatment details were analyzed for 7 patients. The median follow-up was 28 months. Rituximab along with CHOP regimen or its variants was commonly used as first-line treatment with initial response rates of 71%. The median progression-free survival was 5 months. The median overall survival was 15 months. CONCLUSION: Lymphomas of the breast are rare but it is crucial to differentiate them from the commoner breast carcinomas as the treatment and prognosis vary vastly.

    Abstract: The recent description of well-defined molecular subtypes of breast cancer has led to the clinical development of a number of successful molecular targets. Particularly, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive type of breast cancer with historically poor outcomes, mainly due to the lack of effective targeted therapies. Recent progresses in materials science have demonstrated the impressive properties of metal-organic framework nanoparticles (NPs) as antitumoral drug delivery systems. Here, in a way to achieve efficient bio-interfaces with cancer cells and improve their internalization, benchmarked MIL-100(Fe) NPs were coated with cell membranes (CMs) derived from the human TNBC cell line MDA-MB-468. The prepared CMs-coated metal-organic framework (CMs_MIL-100(Fe)) showed enhanced colloidal stability, cellular uptake, and cytotoxicity in MDA-MB-468 cells compared to non-coated NPs, paving the way for these human CMs-coated MIL-100(Fe) NPs as effective targeted therapies against the challenging TNBC.

    Title: Shared decision-making for supporting women's decisions about breast cancer screening.
    Authors: Riganti P, Ruiz Yanzi MV, Escobar Liquitay CM, Sgarbossa NJ, Alarcon-Ruiz CA, Kopitowski KS, Franco JV
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: In breast cancer screening programmes, women may have discussions with a healthcare provider to help them decide whether or not they wish to join the breast cancer screening programme. This process is called shared decision-making (SDM) and involves discussions and decisions based on the evidence and the person's values and preferences. SDM is becoming a recommended approach in clinical guidelines, extending beyond decision aids. However, the overall effect of SDM in women deciding to participate in breast cancer screening remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of SDM on women's satisfaction, confidence, and knowledge when deciding whether to participate in breast cancer screening. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 8 August 2023. We also screened abstracts from two relevant conferences from 2020 to 2023. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs assessing interventions targeting various components of SDM. The focus was on supporting women aged 40 to 75 at average or above-average risk of breast cancer in their decision to participate in breast cancer screening. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and conducted data extraction, risk of bias assessment, and GRADE assessment of the certainty of the evidence. Review outcomes included satisfaction with the decision-making process, confidence in the decision made, knowledge of all options, adherence to the chosen option, women's involvement in SDM, woman-clinician communication, and mental health. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 19 studies with 64,215 randomised women, mostly with an average to moderate risk of breast cancer. Two studies covered all aspects of SDM; six examined shortened forms of SDM involving communication on risks and personal values; and 11 focused on enhanced communication of risk without other SDM aspects. SDM involving all components compared to control The two eligible studies did not assess satisfaction with the SDM process or confidence in the decision. Based on a single study, SDM showed uncertain effects on participant knowledge regarding the age to start screening (risk ratio (RR) 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 2.28; 133 women; very low certainty evidence) and frequency of testing (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.04; 133 women; very low certainty evidence). Other review outcomes were not measured. Abbreviated forms of SDM with clarification of values and preferences compared to control Of the six included studies, none evaluated satisfaction with the SDM process. These interventions may reduce conflict in the decision made, based on two measures, Decisional Conflict Scale scores (mean difference (MD) -1.60, 95% CI -4.21 to 0.87; conflict scale from 0 to 100; 4 studies; 1714 women; very low certainty evidence) and the proportion of women with residual conflict compared to control at one to three months' follow-up (rate of women with a conflicted decision, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.99; 1 study; 1001 women, very low certainty evidence). Knowledge of all options was assessed through knowledge scores and informed choice. The effect of SDM may enhance knowledge (MDs ranged from 0.47 to 1.44 higher scores on a scale from 0 to 10; 5 studies; 2114 women; low certainty evidence) and may lead to higher rates of informed choice (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.63; 4 studies; 2449 women; low certainty evidence) compared to control at one to three months' follow-up. These interventions may result in little to no difference in anxiety (MD 0.54, 95% -0.96 to 2.14; scale from 20 to 80; 2 studies; 749 women; low certainty evidence) and the number of women with worries about cancer compared to control at four to six weeks' follow-up (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.06; 1 study, 639 women; low certainty evidence). Other review outcomes were not measured. Enhanced communication about risks without other SDM aspects compared to control Of 11 studies, three did not report relevant outcomes for this review, and none assessed satisfaction with the SDM process. Confidence in the decision made was measured by decisional conflict and anticipated regret of participating in screening or not. These interventions, without addressing values and preferences, may result in lower confidence in the decision compared to regular communication strategies at two weeks' follow-up (MD 2.89, 95% CI -2.35 to 8.14; Decisional Conflict Scale from 0 to 100; 2 studies; 1191 women; low certainty evidence). They may result in higher anticipated regret if participating in screening (MD 0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.41) and lower anticipated regret if not participating in screening (MD -0.28, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.14). These interventions increase knowledge (MD 1.14, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.62; scale from 0 to 10; 4 studies; 2510 women; high certainty evidence), while it is unclear if there is a higher rate of informed choice compared to regular communication strategies at two to four weeks' follow-up (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.92; 2 studies; 1805 women; low certainty evidence). These interventions result in little to no difference in anxiety (MD 0.33, 95% CI -1.55 to 0.99; scale from 20 to 80) and depression (MD 0.02, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.45; scale from 0 to 21; 2 studies; 1193 women; high certainty evidence) and lower cancer worry compared to control (MD -0.17, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.08; scale from 1 to 4; 1 study; 838 women; high certainty evidence). Other review outcomes were not measured. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Studies using abbreviated forms of SDM and other forms of enhanced communications indicated improvements in knowledge and reduced decisional conflict. However, uncertainty remains about the effect of SDM on supporting women's decisions. Most studies did not evaluate outcomes considered important for this review topic, and those that did measured different concepts. High-quality randomised trials are needed to evaluate SDM in diverse cultural settings with a focus on outcomes such as women's satisfaction with choices aligned to their values.

    Title: Novel carbamodithioate regulates cellular hypoxia through chemical activation of prolyl hydroxylase-2 for breast cancer chemoprevention.
    Authors: Rastogi S, Ansari MN, Saeedan AS, Yadav S, Kumar D, Singh SK, Mukerjee A, Singh M, Kaithwas G
    Abstract: Inhibition of prolylhydroxylase-2 (PHD-2) in both normoxic and hypoxic cells is a critical component of solid tumours. The present study aimed to identify small molecules with PHD-2 activation potential. Virtually screening 4342 chemical compounds for structural similarity to R59949 and docking with PHD-2. To find the best drug candidate, hits were assessed for drug likeliness, antihypoxic and antineoplastic potential. The selected drug candidate's PHD-2 activation, cytotoxic and apoptotic potentials were assessed using 2-oxoglutarate, MTT, AO/EtBr and JC-1 staining. The drug candidate was also tested for its in-vivo chemopreventive efficacy against DMBA-induced mammary gland cancer alone and in combination with Tirapazamine (TPZ). Virtual screening and 2-oxoglutarate assay showed BBAP-6 as lead compound. BBAP-6 exhibited cytotoxic and apoptotic activity against ER+ MCF-7. In carmine staining and histology, BBAP-6 alone or in combination with TPZ restored normal surface morphology of the mammary gland after DMBA produced malignant alterations. Immunoblotting revealed that BBAP-6 reduced NF-kappaB expression, activated PHD-2 and induced intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Serum metabolomics conducted with 1H NMR confirmed that BBAP-6 prevented HIF-1alpha and NF-kappaB-induced metabolic changes in DMBA mammary gland cancer model. In a nutshell, it can be concluded that BBAP-6 activates PHD-2 and exhibits anticancer potential.

    Title: Use of MRI Radiomics Models in Evaluating the Low HER2 Expression in Breast Cancer.
    Authors: Li H, Hou Y, Xue LY, Fan WL, Gao BL, Yin XP
    Abstract: To investigate the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomics models in evaluating the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2(HER2) expression in breast cancer. <P> Materials and Methods: The MRI data of 161 patients with invasive ductal carcinoma (non-special type) of breast cancer were retrospectively collected, and the MRI radiomics models were established based on the MRI imaging features of the fat suppression T2 weighted image (T2WI) sequence, dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-T1WIsequence and joint sequences. The T-test and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm were used for feature dimensionality reduction and screening, respectively, and the random forest (RF) algorithm was used to construct the classification model. <P> Results: The model established by the LASSO-RF algorithm was used in the ROC curve analysis. In predicting the low expression state of HER2 in breast cancer, the radiomics models of the fat suppression T2WI sequence, DCE-T1WI sequence, and the combination of the two sequences showed better predictive efficiency. In the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for the verification set of low, negative, and positive HER2 expression, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) value was 0.81, 0.72, and 0.62 for the DCE-T1WI sequence model, 0.79, 0.65 and 0.77 for the T2WI sequence model, and 0.84, 0.73 and 0.66 for the joint sequence model, respectively. The joint sequence model had the highest AUC value. <P> Conclusions: The MRI radiomics models can be used to effectively predict the HER2 expression in breast cancer and provide a non-invasive and early assistant method for clinicians to formulate individualized and accurate treatment plans.

    Title: Estrogen signalling and Alzheimer's disease: Decoding molecular mechanisms for therapeutic breakthrough.
    Authors: Rishabh, Rohilla M, Bansal S, Bansal N, Chauhan S, Sharma S, Goyal N, Gupta S
    Abstract: In females, Alzheimer's disease (AD) incidences increases as compared to males due to estrogen deficiency after menopause. Estrogen therapy is the mainstay therapy for menopause and associated complications. Estrogen, a hormone with multifaceted physiological functions, has been implicated in AD pathophysiology. Estrogen plays a crucial role in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and overall neuronal health by regulating various factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), intracellular calcium signalling, death domain-associated protein (Daxx) translocation, glutamatergic excitotoxicity, Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel, Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 Receptor, estrogen-metabolising enzymes and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) protein polymorphisms. All these factors impact the physiology of postmenopausal women. Estrogen replacement therapies play an important treatment strategy to prevent AD after menopause. However, use of these therapies may lead to increased risks of breast cancer, venous thromboembolism and cardiovascular disease. Various therapeutic approaches have been used to mitigate the effects of estrogen on AD. These include hormone replacement therapy, Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs), Estrogen Receptor Beta (ERbeta)-Selective Agonists, Transdermal Estrogen Delivery, Localised Estrogen Delivery, Combination Therapies, Estrogen Metabolism Modulation and Alternative Estrogenic Compounds like genistein from soy, a notable phytoestrogen from plant sources. However, mechanism via which these approaches modulate AD in postmenopausal women has not been explained earlier thoroughly. Present review will enlighten all the molecular mechanisms of estrogen and estrogen replacement therapies in AD. Along-with this, the association between estrogen, estrogen-metabolising enzymes and ApoE protein polymorphisms will also be discussed in postmenopausal AD.

    Title: Preoperative Differentiation of HER2-Zero and HER2-Low from HER2-Positive Invasive Ductal Breast Cancers Using BI-RADS MRI Features and Machine Learning Modeling.
    Authors: Zhou J, Zhang Y, Miao H, Yoon GY, Wang J, Lin Y, Wang H, Liu YL, Chen JH, Pan Z, Su MY, Wang M
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Accurate determination of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is important for choosing optimal HER2 targeting treatment strategies. HER2-low is currently considered HER2-negative, but patients may be eligible to receive new anti-HER2 drug conjugates. PURPOSE: To use breast MRI BI-RADS features for classifying three HER2 levels, first to distinguish HER2-zero from HER2-low/positive (Task-1), and then to distinguish HER2-low from HER2-positive (Task-2). STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. POPULATION: 621 invasive ductal cancer, 245 HER2-zero, 191 HER2-low, and 185 HER2-positive. For Task-1, 488 cases for training and 133 for testing. For Task-2, 294 cases for training and 82 for testing. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3.0 T; 3D T1-weighted DCE, short time inversion recovery T2, and single-shot EPI DWI. ASSESSMENT: Pathological information and BI-RADS features were compared. Random Forest was used to select MRI features, and then four machine learning (ML) algorithms: decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and artificial neural nets (ANN), were applied to build models. STATISTICAL TESTS: Chi-square test, one-way analysis of variance, and Kruskal-Wallis test were performed. The P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. For ML models, the generated probability was used to construct the ROC curves. RESULTS: Peritumoral edema, the presence of multiple lesions and non-mass enhancement (NME) showed significant differences. For distinguishing HER2-zero from non-zero (low + positive), multiple lesions, edema, margin, and tumor size were selected, and the k-NN model achieved the highest AUC of 0.86 in the training set and 0.79 in the testing set. For differentiating HER2-low from HER2-positive, multiple lesions, edema, and margin were selected, and the DT model achieved the highest AUC of 0.79 in the training set and 0.69 in the testing set. DATA CONCLUSION: BI-RADS features read by radiologists from preoperative MRI can be analyzed using more sophisticated feature selection and ML algorithms to build models for the classification of HER2 status and identify HER2-low. TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.

    Title: Mapping the function of MicroRNAs as a critical regulator of tumor-immune cell communication in breast cancer and potential treatment strategies.
    Authors: Abdul Manap AS, Wisham AA, Wong FW, Ahmad Najmi HR, Ng ZF, Diba RS
    Abstract: Among women, breast cancer ranks as the most prevalent form of cancer, and the presence of metastases significantly reduces prognosis and diminishes overall survival rates. Gaining insights into the biological mechanisms governing the conversion of cancer cells, their subsequent spread to other areas of the body, and the immune system's monitoring of tumor growth will contribute to the advancement of more efficient and targeted therapies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a critical role in the interaction between tumor cells and immune cells, facilitating tumor cells' evasion of the immune system and promoting cancer progression. Additionally, miRNAs also influence metastasis formation, including the establishment of metastatic sites and the transformation of tumor cells into migratory phenotypes. Specifically, dysregulated expression of these genes has been associated with abnormal expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, thereby facilitating tumor development. This study aims to provide a concise overview of the significance and function of miRNAs in breast cancer, focusing on their involvement as tumor suppressors in the antitumor immune response and as oncogenes in metastasis formation. Furthermore, miRNAs hold tremendous potential as targets for gene therapy due to their ability to modulate specific pathways that can either promote or suppress carcinogenesis. This perspective highlights the latest strategies developed for miRNA-based therapies.

    Title: Transcriptomic analysis of GITR and GITR ligand reveals cancer immune heterogeneity with implications for GITR targeting.
    Authors: Moussa P, Kurzrock R, Nishizaki D, Miyashita H, Lee S, Nikanjam M, Pabla S, Nesline MK, Ko H, Conroy JM, DePietro P, Sicklick JK, Kato S
    Abstract: Glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor related protein (GITR) is a transmembrane protein expressed mostly on CD25(+)CD4(+) regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and upregulated on all T-cells upon activation. It is a T-cell co-stimulatory receptor and has demonstrated promising anti-tumor activity in pre-clinical studies. To date, however, the efficacy of GITR agonism has been discouraging in clinical trials. This study explores GITR and GITR ligand (GITR-L) ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression in solid tumors in an attempt to delineate causes for variable responses to GITR agonists. RNA expression levels of 514 patients with a variety of cancer types were normalized to internal housekeeping gene profiles and ranked as percentiles. 99/514 patients (19.3%) had high GITR expression (defined as >/= 75th percentile). Breast and lung cancer had the highest proportion of patients with high GITR expression (39% and 35%, respectively). The expression of concomitant high GITR and low-moderate GITR-L expression (defined as <75th percentile) was present in 31% and 30% of patients with breast and lung cancer respectively. High GITR expression also showed a significant independent association with high RNA expression of other immune modulator proteins, namely, PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) >/=1 (odds ratio (OR) 2.15, P=0.008), CTLA4 (OR=2.17, P=0.05) and OX40 high RNA expression (OR=2.64, P=0.001). Overall, these results suggest that breast and lung cancer have a high proportion of patients with a GITR and GITR-L RNA expression profile that merits further investigation in GITR agonism studies. The association of high GITR expression with high CTLA4 and OX40 RNA expression, as well as positive PD-L1 IHC, provides a rationale for a combination approach targeting these specific immune modulator proteins in patients whose tumors show such co-expression.

    Title: Development and validation of a random survival forest model for predicting long-term survival of early-stage young breast cancer patients based on the SEER database and an external validation cohort.
    Authors: Li LW, Liu X, Shen ML, Zhao MJ, Liu H
    Abstract: Young breast cancer (YBC) patients often face a poor prognosis, hence it's necessary to construct a model that can accurately predict their long-term survival in early stage. To realize this goal, we utilized data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) databases between January 2010 and December 2020, and meanwhile, enrolled an independent external cohort from Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital. The study aimed to develop and validate a prediction model constructed using the Random Survival Forest (RSF) machine learning algorithm. By applying the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analysis, we pinpointed key prognostic factors for YBC patients, which were used to create a prediction model capable of forecasting the 3-year, 5-year, 7-year, and 10-year survival rates of YBC patients. The RSF model constructed in the study demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving C-index values of 0.920 in the training set, 0.789 in the internal validation set, and 0.701 in the external validation set, outperforming the Cox regression model. The model's calibration was confirmed by Brier scores at various time points, showcasing its excellent accuracy in prediction. Decision curve analysis (DCA) underscored the model's importance in clinical application, and the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) plots highlighted the importance of key variables. The RSF model also proved valuable in risk stratification, which has effectively categorized patients based on their survival risks. In summary, this study has constructed a well-performed prediction model for the evaluation of prognostic factors influencing the long-term survival of early-stage YBC patients, which is significant in risk stratification when physicians handle YBC patients in clinical settings.

    Title: Synergistic induction of autophagy in gastric cancer by targeting CDK4/6 and MEK through AMPK/mTOR pathway.
    Authors: Zhou H, Li G, Kan L, Yang M, Liu Y, Miu X, Shi L, Yang Z, Zheng X, Chen H, Ren C
    Abstract: KRAS is a commonly mutated oncogene in human gastric cancer and is often associated with drug resistance and poor prognosis. Co-clinical trial of combined MEK-CDK4/6 inhibition in KRAS mutated cancers demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in patient-derived xenografts and safety in patients. Here, present research focuses on targeting CDK4/6 and MEK synergistically block the proliferation of KRAS-mutated gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo and induced autophagy through the AMPK/mTOR pathway. Furthermore, autophagy inhibitor combined with targeting CDK4/6 and MEK therapy had significant antitumor effects on KRAS mutant gastric cancer cells. Clinical trials are needed to determine the mechanism behind this finding and its clinical utility. In conclusion, our results demonstrate autophagy inhibitor combined targeting MEK and CDK4/6 that concurrently block multiple metabolic processes may be an effective therapeutic approach for gastric cancer.

    Title: Identification of molecular subtypes based on chromatin regulator-related genes and experimental verification of the role of ASCL1 in conferring chemotherapy resistance to breast cancer.
    Authors: Li Y, Yang X, Geng C, Liu Y, Tang T, Zhang L, Liu F, Zhang M, Hao J, Ma L
    Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the molecular subtypes of breast cancer based on chromatin regulator-related genes. METHODS: The RNA sequencing data of The Cancer Genome Atlas-Breast Cancer cohort were obtained from the official website, while the single-cell data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GSE176078). Validation was performed using the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium dataset. Furthermore, the immune characteristics, tumor stemness, heterogeneity, and clinical characteristics of these molecular subtypes were analyzed. The correlation between chromatin regulators and chemotherapy resistance was examined in vitro using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assays. RESULTS: This study identified three stable molecular subtypes with different prognostic and pathological features. Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and protein-protein interaction analyses revealed that the differentially expressed genes were associated with disease processes, such as mitotic nuclear division, chromosome segregation, condensed chromosome, and specific chromosome region. The T stage and subtypes were correlated with the clinical features. Tumor heterogeneity (mutant-allele tumor heterogeneity, tumor mutational burden, purity, and homologous recombination deficiency) and tumor stemness (RNA expression-based stemness score, epigenetically regulated RNA expression-based stemness score, DNA methylation-based stemness score, and epigenetically regulated DNA methylation-based stemness score) significantly varied between the three subtypes. Furthermore, Western blotting, qRT-PCR, and CCK8 assays demonstrated that the expression of ASCL1 was positively correlated with chemotherapy resistance in breast cancer. CONCLUSION: This study identified the subtypes of breast cancer based on chromatin regulators and analyzed their clinical features, gene mutation status, immunophenotype, and drug sensitivity. The results of this study provide effective strategies for assessing clinical prognosis and developing personalized treatment strategies.

    Title: Associations of serum cystatin C concentrations with total mortality and mortality of 12 site-specific cancers.
    Authors: Huang C, Lu J, Yang J, Wang Z, Hang D, Fu Z
    Abstract: PURPOSE: Cystatin C (CysC), beyond its biomarker role of renal function, has been implicated in various physical and pathological activities. However, the impact of serum CysC on cancer mortality in a general population remains unknown. We aimed to examine the associations of serum CysC concentrations with total mortality and mortality of 12 site-specific cancers. METHODS: We included 241,008 participants of the UK Biobank cohort with CysC measurements who had normal creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rates and were free of cancer and renal diseases at baseline (2006-2010). Death information was obtained from the National Health Service death records through 28 February 2021. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to compute hazard ratios (HR) per one standard deviation increase in log-transformed CysC concentrations and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for mortality. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 12.1 (interquartile range, 11.3-12.8) years, 5,744 cancer deaths occurred. We observed a positive association between serum CysC concentrations and total cancer mortality (HR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.12-1.20). Specifically, participants with higher serum CysC concentrations had increased mortality due to lung cancer (HR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.05-1.20), blood cancer (HR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.16-1.44), brain cancer (HR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.04-1.36), esophageal cancer (HR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.05-1.37), breast cancer (HR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.03-1.36), and liver cancer (HR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.31-1.69). CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that higher CysC concentrations are associated with increased mortality due to lung, blood, brain, esophageal, breast, and liver cancers. Future studies are necessary to clarify underlying mechanisms.

    Title: Nuclear Softness Promotes the Metastatic Potential of Large-Nucleated Colorectal Cancer Cells via the ErbB4-Akt1-Lamin A/C Signaling Pathway.
    Authors: Li Y, Li Q, Mu L, Hu Y, Yan C, Zhao H, Mi Y, Li X, Tao D, Qin J
    Abstract: Abnormal nuclear enlargement is a diagnostic and physical hallmark of malignant tumors. Large nuclei are positively associated with an increased risk of developing metastasis; however, a large nucleus is inevitably more resistant to cell migration due to its size. The present study demonstrated that the nuclear size of primary colorectal cancer (CRC) cells at an advanced stage was larger than cells at an early stage. In addition, the nuclei of CRC liver metastases were larger than those of the corresponding primary CRC tissues. CRC cells were sorted into large-nucleated cells (LNCs) and small-nucleated cells (SNCs). Purified LNCs exhibited greater constricted migratory and metastatic capacity than SNCs in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, ErbB4 was highly expressed in LNCs, which phosphorylated lamin A/C at serine 22 via the ErbB4-Akt1 signaling pathway. Furthermore, the level of phosphorylated lamin A/C was a negative determinant of nuclear stiffness. Taken together, CRC LNCs possessed greater constricted migratory and metastatic potential than SNCs due to ErbB4-Akt1-mediated lamin A/C phosphorylation and nuclear softening. These results may provide a potential treatment strategy for tumor metastasis by targeting nuclear stiffness in patients with cancer, particularly CRC.

    Title: E3 ubiquitin ligase BCA2 promotes breast cancer stemness by up-regulation of SOX9 by LPS.
    Authors: Zheng M, Liu W, Zhang R, Jiang D, Shi Y, Wu Y, Ge F, Chen C
    Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most malignant subtype of breast cancer. Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are believed to play a crucial role in the carcinogenesis, therapy resistance, and metastasis of TNBC. It is well known that inflammation promotes stemness. Several studies have identified breast cancer-associated gene 2 (BCA2) as a potential risk factor for breast cancer incidence and prognosis. However, whether and how BCA2 promotes BCSCs has not been elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that BCA2 specifically promotes lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BCSCs through LPS induced SOX9 expression. BCA2 enhances the interaction between myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and inhibits the interaction of MyD88 with deubiquitinase OTUD4 in the LPS-mediated NF-kappaB signaling pathway. And SOX9, an NF-kappaB target gene, mediates BCA2's pro-stemness function in TNBC. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which BCA2 promotes breast cancer and potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of breast cancer.

    Title: Ciliogenesis-associated Kinase 1 Promotes Breast Cancer Cell Proliferation and Chemoresistance via Phosphorylating ERK1.
    Authors: He Y, Zhang X, Pan W, Zhang J, Zhu W, Zhang J, Shi J
    Abstract: Ciliogenesis-associated kinase 1 (CILK1) plays a key role in the ciliogenesis and ciliopathies. It remains totally unclear whether CILK1 is involved in tumor progression and therapy resistance. Here, we report that the aberrant high-expression of CILK1 in breast cancer is required for tumor cell proliferation and chemoresistance. Two compounds, CILK1-C30 and CILK1-C28, were identified with selective inhibitory effects towards the Tyr-159/Thr-157 dual-phosphorylation of CILK1, pharmacological inhibition of CILK1 significantly suppressed tumor cell proliferation and overcame chemoresistance in multiple experimental models. Large-scale screen of CILK1 substrates confirmed that the kinase directly phosphorylates ERK1, which is responsible for CILK1-mediated oncogenic function. CILK1 is also indicated to be responsible for the chemoresistance of small-cell lung cancer cells. Our data highlight the importance of CILK1 in cancer, implicating that targeting CILK1/ERK1 might offer therapeutic benefit to cancer patients.

    Title: Appendiceal Metastasis of Breast Cancer: A Case Report and a Literature Review.
    Authors: Yagyu T, Miki H, Kikawa Y, Kobayashi T, Sekimoto M
    Abstract: Appendiceal metastases of breast cancer (BC) are very rare, and there are few reports of resection. Asymptomatic appendiceal enlargement is often suspected to be a primary appendiceal tumor, making it difficult to suspect metastatic tumors, especially metastases from BC. On the other hand, advances in drug therapy, including hormonal therapy for BC, have prolonged survival, and there is a possibility of encountering metastatic cases that have rarely been seen before. We herein present a case in which an enlarged appendix, identified during hormonal therapy for advanced BC, was laparoscopically removed and diagnosed as BC metastasis. A 53-year-old woman had been diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) based on a breast biopsy, and the appendiceal specimen was diagnosed as invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). We herein report this unique case and provide a detailed review of 13 previous reports.

    Title: Geographic and Physician-Level Variation in the Use of Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Breast Cancer in the U.S.: A Cross-Classified Multilevel Analysis.
    Authors: Sun Y, Saulsberry L, Liao C, Hedeker D, Huo D
    Abstract: PURPOSE: We aimed to assess geographic and physician-level variation for hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation (HF-WBI) use for early-stage breast cancer patients in the United States. We further evaluated the association between HF-WBI use and demographic factors after accounting for these variations. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We performed a retrospective study of early-stage breast cancer patients using private employer-sponsored insurance claims from 2008 to 2017. Patients were clustered according to geographic level and by radiation oncologist. Bayesian cross-classified multilevel logistic models were used to examine the geographic heterogeneity and variation of radiation oncologists simultaneously. Intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) and median odds ratios (MOR) were calculated to quantify the variation at different levels. We also used the cross-classified model to identify patient demographic factors associated with receiving HF-WBI. RESULTS: The study included 79,747 women (74.0%) who received conventionally fractionated whole-breast irradiation (CF-WBI) and 27,999 women (26.0%) who underwent HF-WBI. HF-WBI adoption increased significantly across time (2008-2017). The variation in HF-WBI utilization was attributed mostly to physician-level variability (MOR = 2.59). The variability of HF-WBI utilization across core-based statistical areas (CBSAs) (MOR = 1.55) was found to be the strongest among all geographic classifications. After accounting for variability in both CBSAs and radiation oncologists, age, receiving chemotherapy, and several community-level factors, including distance from home to facility, community education level, and racial composition, were found to be associated with HF-WBI utilization. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated geographic and physician-level heterogeneity in the use of HF-WBI among early-stage breast cancer patients. HF-WBI utilization was also found to be associated with patient and community-level characteristics. Given observed physician-level variability, intervention through continuing medical education could help doctors to better understand the advantages of HF-WBI and promote the adoption of HF-WBI in the U.S. Influence of physician-level characteristics on HF-WBI utilization merits further study.

    Title: BRCA testing and management of BRCA-mutated early-stage breast cancer: a comprehensive statement by expert group from GCC region.
    Authors: Al-Shamsi HO, Alwbari A, Azribi F, Calaud F, Thuruthel S, Tirmazy SHH, Kullab S, Ostomane S, Abulkhair O
    Abstract: BReast CAncer (BRCA)1 and BRCA2 gene pathogenic variants account for most hereditary breast cancers (BC). Identification of BRCA mutations can significantly influence both prognosis and treatment outcomes. Furthermore, it enables the identification of individuals who are at heightened risk of developing BC due to inherited genetic mutations. Many developing countries rely on western guidelines for BRCA testing and BC management; however, there exist wide disparities in the prevalence of risk factors, availability of medical resources, and practice patterns. Guidelines tailored to specific regions can help mitigate healthcare variations, promote consistency in treatment, and aid healthcare providers in identifying effective therapies for improving patient outcomes. Hence, oncologists from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) congregated virtually in March 2023 and reviewed existing data on the epidemiology of BC, BRCA mutations, practices and challenges associated with BRCA testing and management of BRCA mutated early-stage BC in the GCC region. They also provided insights on the real-world diagnostic and treatment practices and challenges in the GCC region in the BRCA-mutated early-stage BC domain and suggested some variations to international guidelines to aid their uptake in this region.

    Title: Voluntary wheel running reduces tumor growth and increases capillarity in the heart during doxorubicin chemotherapy in a murine model of breast cancer.
    Authors: Uurasmaa TM, Ricardo C, Autio A, Heinonen IHA, Rundqvist H, Anttila K
    Abstract: Introduction: The possible beneficial effects of physical activity during doxorubicin treatment of breast cancer need further investigation as many of the existing studies have been done on non-tumor-bearing models. Therefore, in this study, we aim to assess whether short-term voluntary wheel-running exercise during doxorubicin treatment of breast cancer-bearing mice could induce beneficial cardiac effects and enhance chemotherapy efficacy. Methods: Murine breast cancer I3TC cells were inoculated subcutaneously to the flank of female FVB mice (n = 16) that were divided into exercised and non-exercised groups. Two weeks later, doxorubicin treatment was started via intraperitoneal administration (5 mg/kg weekly for 3 weeks). Organs were harvested a day after the last dose. Results: The tumor volume over time was significantly different between the groups, with the exercising group having lower tumor volumes. The exercised group had increased body weight gain, tumor apoptosis, capillaries per cardiomyocytes, and cardiac lactate dehydrogenase activity compared to the unexercised group, but tumor blood vessel density and maturation and tumor and cardiac HIF1-alpha and VEGF-A levels did not differ from those of the non-exercised group. Discussion: We conclude that even short-term light exercise such as voluntary wheel running exercise can decrease the subcutaneous mammary tumor growth, possibly via increased tumor apoptosis. The increase in cardiac capillaries per cardiomyocytes may also have positive effects on cancer treatment outcomes.

    Title: Gynecologic Care of Black Breast Cancer Survivors.
    Authors: Pleasant V
    Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Black patients suffer from breast cancer-related racial health disparities, which could have implications on their gynecologic care. This review explores considerations in the gynecologic care of Black breast cancer survivors. RECENT FINDINGS: Black people have a higher risk of leiomyoma and endometrial cancer, which could confound bleeding patterns such as in the setting of tamoxifen use. As Black people are more likely to have early-onset breast cancer, this may have implications on long-term bone and heart health. Black patients may be more likely to have menopausal symptoms at baseline and as a result of breast cancer treatment. Furthermore, Black patients are less likely to utilize assisted reproductive technology and genetic testing services. SUMMARY: It is important for healthcare providers to be well-versed in the intersections of breast cancer and gynecologic care. Black breast cancer survivors may have unique considerations for which practitioners should be knowledgeable.

    Title: Is Body Appreciation a Moderator of Women's Satisfaction and Distress with the Body Changes that Occur after Breast Cancer Surgery? A One-Year Longitudinal Study.
    Authors: Marco-Salvador JH, Castejon Raven J, Grau Sevilla MD, Ripoll Orts F
    Abstract: Women with breast cancer show dissatisfaction with their appearance, a perception of loss of femininity and bodily integrity, and dissatisfaction with the outcome of the surgery. Body Appreciation (BA) is defined as positive attitudes toward one's body, beyond satisfaction and dissatisfaction with one's appearance. Although studies about the protective role of BA have increased, to the best of our knowledge, there are no published studies on the association between BA, body dissatisfaction, and distress in participants with breast cancer. The aims of this study are: (a) To analyze whether BA is a moderator of satisfaction with the body from before breast surgery to the one-year follow-up; and (b) to analyze whether BA is a moderator of distress from before breast surgery to the one-year follow-up. The sample consisted of 115 women diagnosed with breast cancer. Several hierarchical regression analyses were conducted. The results indicated that BA moderated the association between the appearance evaluation before the surgery and the appearance evaluation 12 months after the surgery. Although BA was a significative predictor of distress, it was not a moderator of distress from the moment before breast surgery to the one-year follow-up. This study highlights the importance of evaluating the construct of BA in participants with breast cancer using longitudinal designs and developing psychological interventions that focus on increasing BA.

    Title: A Competing Risk Nomogram for Prediction of Prognosis in Patients With Primary Squamous Cell Thyroid Carcinoma.
    Authors: Tian Y, He L, Zhang B, Deng L, Wang J
    Abstract: Objective: Primary squamous cell thyroid carcinoma (PSCTC) is an extremely rare carcinoma, accounting for less than 1% of all thyroid carcinomas. However, the factors contributing to PSCTC outcomes remain unclear. This study aimed to identify the prognostic factors and develop a prognostic predictive model for patients with PSCTC. Methods: The analysis included patients diagnosed with thyroid carcinoma between 1975 and 2016 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Prognostic differences among the 5 pathological types of thyroid carcinomas were analyzed. To determine prognostic factors in PSCTC patients, the Cox regression model and Fine-Gray competing risk model were utilized. Based on the Fine-Gray competing risk model, a nomogram was established for predicting the prognosis of patients with PSCTC. Results: A total of 198,757 thyroid carcinoma patients, including 218 PSCTC patients, were identified. We found that PSCTC and anaplastic thyroid cancer had the worst prognosis among the 5 pathological types of thyroid carcinoma (P < .001). According to univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, age (71-95 years) was an independent risk factor for poorer overall survival and disease-specific survival in PSCTC patients. Using Fine-Gray regression analysis, the total number of in situ/malignant tumors for patient (Number 1) (>/=2) was identified as an independent protective factor for prognosis of PSCTC. The area under the curve, the concordance index (C-index), calibration curves and decision curve analysis revealed that the nomogram was capable of predicting the prognosis of PSCTC patients accurately. Conclusion: The competing risk nomogram is highly accurate in predicting prognosis for patients with PSCTC, which may help clinicians to optimize individualized treatment decisions.

    Title: The role of clinical breast examination and fine needle aspiration cytology in early detection of breast cancer: A cross-sectional study nested in a cohort in a low-resource setting.
    Authors: Mremi A, Pallangyo A, Mshana T, Mashauri O, Kimario W, Nkya G, Mwakyembe TE, Mollel E, Amsi P, Mmbaga BT
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is prevalent worldwide, with disparities in screening, diagnosis, treatment outcomes, and survival. In Africa, the majority of women are diagnosed at advanced stages, affecting treatment outcomes. Screening is one of the best strategies to reduce mortality rates caused by this cancer. Yet in a resource-constrained setting, there is limited access to screening and early detection services, which are available only at a few referral hospitals. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the prevalence and screening results of breast cancer using clinical breast examination coupled with fine needle aspiration cytology in a resource-constraint setting. DESIGN: A combined cross-sectional and cohort study. METHODS: Women at risk of developing breast cancer in the Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania were invited, through public announcements, to their primary healthcare facilities. A questionnaire was used to assess the participants' characteristics. The women received a clinical breast examination, and detectable lesions were subjected to a confirmatory fine needle aspiration cytology or an excisional biopsy. Preliminary data from this ongoing breast cancer control program were extracted and analyzed for this study. RESULTS: A total of 3577 women were screened for breast cancer; their mean age was 47 +/- 7.53 years. About a third of them (1145, 32%) were practicing self-breast examination at least once a month. Of 200 (5.6%) with abnormal clinical breast examination, 18 (9%) were confirmed to be breast cancer, making the prevalence to be 0.5%. The vast majority of participants with breast cancer (13, 72.2%) had early disease stages, and infiltrating ductal carcinoma, no special type, was the most common (15, 83.3%) histopathology subtype. Hormonal receptor status determination results indicated that 11 (61.1%), 7 (38.9%), and 5 (27.8%) of the tumors overexpressed estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal receptor-2, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates 5.6% of Tanzanian women have abnormal clinical breast examination findings, with 9% having breast cancer. Nearly three-quarters (72.2%) of breast cancer screened for early disease were detected in the early disease stages. This finding suggests that organized screening with clinical breast examination coupled with fine needle aspiration cytology, which is a simple and cost-effective screening method, has the potential to improve early detection and outcomes for breast cancer patients in a resource-constraint setting.

    Title: A 3'-pre-tRNA-derived small RNA tRF-1-Ser regulated by 25(OH)D promotes proliferation and stemness by inhibiting the function of MBNL1 in breast cancer.
    Authors: Wan X, Shi W, Ma L, Wang L, Zheng R, He J, Wang Y, Li X, Zha X, Wang J, Xu L
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: We explored the potential novel anticancer mechanisms of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), a vitamin D metabolite with antitumour effects in breast cancer. It is stable in serum and is used to assess vitamin D levels in clinical practice. Transfer RNA-derived small RNAs are small noncoding RNAs that generate various distinct biological functions, but more research is needed on their role in breast cancer. METHODS: Small RNA microarrays were used to explore the novel regulatory mechanism of 25(OH)D. High-throughput RNA-sequencing technology was used to detect transcriptome changes after 25(OH)D treatment and tRF-1-Ser knockdown. RNA pull-down and high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry were used to explore the proteins bound to tRF-1-Ser. In vitro and in vivo functional experiments were conducted to assess the influence of 25(OH)D and tRF-1-Ser on breast cancer. Semi-quantitative PCR was performed to detect alternative splicing events. Western blot assay and qPCR were used to assess protein and mRNA expression. RESULTS: The expression of tRF-1-Ser is negatively regulated by 25(OH)D. In our breast cancer (BRCA) clinical samples, we found that the expression of tRF-1-Ser was higher in cancer tissues than in paired normal tissues, and was significantly associated with tumour invasion. Moreover, tRF-1-Ser inhibits the function of MBNL1 by hindering its nuclear translocation. Functional experiments and transcriptome data revealed that the downregulation of tRF-1-Ser plays a vital role in the anticancer effect of 25(OH)D. CONCLUSIONS: In brief, our research revealed a novel anticancer mechanism of 25(OH)D, unveiled the vital function of tRF-1-Ser in BRCA progression, and suggested that tRF-1-Ser could emerge as a new therapeutic target for BRCA.

    Title: PD-L1 intrinsically promotes the proliferation of breast cancer cells through the SKP2-p27/p21 axis.
    Authors: Elfoly M, Mirza JY, Alaiya A, Al-Hazzani AA, Tulbah A, Al-Alwan M, Ghebeh H
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: PD-L1 intrinsically promotes tumor progression through multiple mechanisms, which potentially leads to resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. The intrinsic effect of PD-L1 on breast cancer (BC) cell proliferation has not been fully elucidated. METHODS: we used proteomics, gene expression knockdown (KD), quantitative immunofluorescence (qIF), western blots, functional assays including colony-forming assay (CFA) and real-time cell analyzer (RTCA), and in vivo data using immunohistochemistry in breast cancer patients. RESULTS: PD-L1 promoted BC cell proliferation by accelerating cell cycle entry at the G1-to-S phase transition. Global proteomic analysis of the differentially expressed nuclear proteins indicated the involvement of several proliferation-related molecules, including p21(CIP1/WAF1). Western blotting and qIF demonstrated the higher expression of SKP2 and the lower expression of p21(CIP1/WAF1) and p27(Kip1) in PD-L1 expressing (PD-L1(pos)) cells as compared to PD-L1 KD (PD-L1(KD)) cells. Xenograft-derived cells and the TCGA BC dataset confirmed this relationship in vivo. Functionally, CFA and RTCA demonstrated the central role of SKP2 in promoting PD-L1-mediated proliferation. Finally, immunohistochemistry in 74 breast cancer patients confirmed PD-L1 and SKP-p21/p27 axis relationship, as it showed a highly statistically significant correlation between SKP2 and PD-L1 expression (p < 0.001), and both correlated significantly with the proliferation marker Ki-67 (p < 0.001). On the other hand, there was a statistically significant inverse relationship between PD-L1 and p21(CIP1/WAF1) expression (p = 0.005). Importantly, double negativity for p21(CIP1/WAF1) and p27(Kip1) correlated significantly with PD-L1 (p < 0.001), SKP2 (p = 0.002), and Ki-67 (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: we have demonstrated the role of the SKP2-p27/p21 axis in intrinsic PD-L1-enhanced cell cycle progression. Inhibitors of SKP2 expression can alleviate resistance to ICPIs.

    Title: Assessment of the axilla in women with early-stage breast cancer undergoing primary surgery: a review.
    Authors: James J, Law M, Sengupta S, Saunders C
    Abstract: Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is routinely performed in people with node-negative early breast cancer to assess the axilla. SNB has no proven therapeutic benefit. Nodal status information obtained from SNB helps in prognostication and can influence adjuvant systemic and locoregional treatment choices. However, the redundancy of the nodal status information is becoming increasingly apparent. The accuracy of radiological assessment of the axilla, combined with the strong influence of tumour biology on systemic and locoregional therapy requirements, has prompted many to consider alternative options for SNB. SNB contributes significantly to decreased quality of life in early breast cancer patients. Substantial improvements in workflow and cost could accrue by removing SNB from early breast cancer treatment. We review the current viewpoints and ideas for alternative options for assessing and managing a clinically negative axilla in patients with early breast cancer (EBC). Omitting SNB in selected cases or replacing SNB with a non-invasive predictive model appear to be viable options based on current literature.

    Title: Association between pathologic complete response and biochemical indicators after neoadjuvant therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer.
    Authors: Chen W, Zhang J, Li F, Chen Z, Li J, Lu DL
    Abstract: PURPOSE: This study investigated the changes in the fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting triglyceride (FTG), and fasting total cholesterol (FTC) levels during neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer (BC) and the association with pathologic complete response (pCR). METHODS: Relevant data from Sichuan Cancer Hospital from June 2019 to June 2022 were collected and analyzed, and FBG, FTG, and FTC were divided into baseline, change, and process groups, which were grouped to analyze the changes after receiving NAT and the association with pCR. RESULTS: In the estrogen receptor (ER)-negative subgroup, patients with low levels of FTG in the process group were more likely to achieve pCR compared to high levels, and in the progesterone receptor (PR)-negative subgroup, patients with lower FTG compared to higher FTG after receiving NAT was more likely to achieve pCR. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HER2-positive BC undergoing NAT develop varying degrees of abnormalities (elevated or decreased) in FBG, FTG, and FTC; moreover, the status of FTG levels during NAT may predict pCR in ER-negative or PR-negative HER2-positive BC.Early monitoring and timely intervention for FTG abnormalities may enable this subset of patients to increase the likelihood of obtaining a pCR along with management of abnormal markers.

    Title: Radiotherapy-sensitized cancer immunotherapy via cGAS-STING immune pathway by activatable nanocascade reaction.
    Authors: Hu H, Zheng S, He C, Zheng Y, Wei Q, Chen S, Wu Z, Xu Y, Zhao B, Yan C
    Abstract: Radiotherapy-induced immune activation holds great promise for optimizing cancer treatment efficacy. Here, we describe a clinically used radiosensitizer hafnium oxide (HfO(2)) that was core coated with a MnO(2) shell followed by a glucose oxidase (GOx) doping nanoplatform (HfO(2)@MnO(2)@GOx, HMG) to trigger ferroptosis adjuvant effects by glutathione depletion and reactive oxygen species production. This ferroptosis cascade potentiation further sensitized radiotherapy by enhancing DNA damage in 4T1 breast cancer tumor cells. The combination of HMG nanoparticles and radiotherapy effectively activated the damaged DNA and Mn(2+)-mediated cGAS-STING immune pathway in vitro and in vivo. This process had significant inhibitory effects on cancer progression and initiating an anticancer systemic immune response to prevent distant tumor recurrence and achieve long-lasting tumor suppression of both primary and distant tumors. Furthermore, the as-prepared HMG nanoparticles "turned on" spectral computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance dual-modality imaging signals, and demonstrated favorable contrast enhancement capabilities activated by under the GSH tumor microenvironment. This result highlighted the potential of nanoparticles as a theranostic nanoplatform for achieving molecular imaging guided tumor radiotherapy sensitization induced by synergistic immunotherapy.

    Title: The prognostic value of lymph node to primary tumor standardized uptake value ratio in cancer patients: a meta-analysis.
    Authors: Yap WK, Hsu KH, Wang TH, Lin CH, Kang CJ, Huang SM, Lin HC, Hung TM, Chang KP, Tsai TY
    Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The lymph node to primary tumor standardized uptake value ratio (NTR) is an innovative parameter derived from positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scans that captures the intricate relationship between primary tumors and associated lymph nodes. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the prognostic value of NTR in cancer patients. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases was conducted to identify studies investigating the association between NTR and survival outcomes in cancer patients. The pooled adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Twelve studies comprising a total of 2037 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Elevated NTR was significantly associated with worse overall survival aHR (2.21, 95% CI 1.63 to 2.99), disease-free survival aHR (3.27, 95% CI 2.12 to 5.05), and distant metastasis-free survival aHR (2.07, 95% CI 1.55 to 2.78) in cancer patients. Subgroup analyses by cancer type showed consistent results across various malignancies, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, lung cancer, breast cancer, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis provides evidence for a significant association between elevated NTR and worse survival outcomes in cancer patients. Elevated NTR may serve as a useful prognostic biomarker for cancer patients and could potentially be used to guide treatment decisions and monitor disease progression. Future studies should aim to validate these findings in larger and more diverse patient populations and investigate the underlying mechanisms for the observed association between NTR and survival outcomes.

    Title: Longitudinal ultrasound-based AI model predicts axillary lymph node response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer: a multicenter study.
    Authors: Fu Y, Lei YT, Huang YH, Mei F, Wang S, Yan K, Wang YH, Ma YH, Cui LG
    Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Developing a deep learning radiomics model from longitudinal breast ultrasound and sonographer's axillary ultrasound diagnosis for predicting axillary lymph node (ALN) response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer. METHODS: Breast cancer patients undergoing NAC followed by surgery were recruited from three centers between November 2016 and December 2022. We collected ultrasound images for extracting tumor-derived radiomics and deep learning features, selecting quantitative features through various methods. Two machine learning models based on random forest were developed using pre-NAC and post-NAC features. A support vector machine integrated these data into a fusion model, evaluated via the area under the curve (AUC), decision curve analysis, and calibration curves. We compared the fusion model's performance against sonographer's diagnosis from pre-NAC and post-NAC axillary ultrasonography, referencing histological outcomes from sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection. RESULTS: In the validation cohort, the fusion model outperformed both pre-NAC (AUC: 0.899 vs. 0.786, p < 0.001) and post-NAC models (AUC: 0.899 vs. 0.853, p = 0.014), as well as the sonographer's diagnosis of ALN status on pre-NAC and post-NAC axillary ultrasonography (AUC: 0.899 vs. 0.719, p < 0.001). Decision curve analysis revealed patient benefits from the fusion model across threshold probabilities from 0.02 to 0.98. The model also enhanced sonographer's diagnostic ability, increasing accuracy from 71.9% to 79.2%. CONCLUSION: The deep learning radiomics model accurately predicted the ALN response to NAC in breast cancer. Furthermore, the model will assist sonographers to improve their diagnostic ability on ALN status before surgery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Our AI model based on pre- and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy ultrasound can accurately predict axillary lymph node metastasis and assist sonographer's axillary diagnosis. KEY POINTS: Axillary lymph node metastasis status affects the choice of surgical treatment, and currently relies on subjective ultrasound. Our AI model outperformed sonographer's visual diagnosis on axillary ultrasound. Our deep learning radiomics model can improve sonographers' diagnosis and might assist in surgical decision-making.

    Title: A Review on Picrosides Targeting NFkappaB and its Proteins for Treatment of Breast Cancer.
    Authors: Soni D, Anjum Z, Raza K, Verma S
    Abstract: Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed disease causing most deaths in women worldwide. Chemotherapy and neo-adjuvant therapy are the standard method of treatment in early stages of breast cancer. However drug resistance in breast cancer limit the use of these methods for treatment. Research focus is now shifted towards identifying natural phytochemicals with lower toxicity. This review illustrates the NF kappaB interaction with different signaling pathways in normal condition, breast cancer and other cancer and thus represent a potential target for treatment. No reports are available on the action of picrosides on NFkappaB and its associated proteins for anticancer activity. In the present review, potential interaction of picrosides with NF-kappaB and its associated proteins is reviewed for anticancer action. Further, an important facet of this review entails the ADMET analysis of Picroside, elucidating key ADMET properties which serves to underscore the crucial characteristics of Picroside as a potential drug for treating breast cancer. Furthermore, in silico analysis of Picrosides was executed in order to get potential binding modes between ligand (Picrosides II) and NFkappaB.

    Title: Acceptability and Feasibility of Survivorship Group Medical Visits for Breast Cancer Survivors in a Safety Net Hospital.
    Authors: Trejo E, Velazquez AI, Castillo E, Couey P, Cicerelli B, McBride R, Burke NJ, Dixit N
    Abstract: Providing cost-effective, comprehensive survivorship care remains a significant challenge. Breast cancer survivors (BCS) who have limited income and are from marginalized racial and ethnic groups experience a worse quality of life and report higher distress. Thus, innovative care models are required to address the needs of BCS in low resource settings. Group medical visits (GMV), utilized in chronic disease management, are an excellent model for education and building skills. This single-arm intervention study was conducted at a public hospital in California. GMVs consisted of five 2-h weekly sessions focused on survivorship care planning, side effects of treatment and prevention, emotional health, sexual health, physical activity, and diet. The patient navigators recruited three consecutive GMV groups of six English-speaking BCS (N = 17). A multidisciplinary team delivered GMVs, and a patient navigator facilitated all the sessions. We used attendance rates, pre- and post-surveys, and debriefing interviews to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. We enrolled 18 BCS. One participant dropped out before the intervention started, 17 BCS consistently attended and actively participated in the GMV, and 76% (13) attended all planned sessions. Participants rated GMVs in the post-survey and shared their support for GMVs in debriefing interviews. The BCS who completed the post-survey reported that GMVs increased their awareness, confidence, and knowledge of survivorship care. GMVs were explicitly designed to address unmet needs for services necessary for survivorship care but not readily available in safety net settings. Our pilot data suggest that patient-navigator-facilitated GMVs are a feasible and acceptable model for integrating survivorship care in public hospitals.

    Abstract: While some clinics have adopted abbreviated neoadjuvant treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer, there remains a shortage of comprehensive clinical data to support this practice. This is a retrospective, multicenter study. A total of 142 patients were included in the study who are HER2-positive breast cancer, aged </= 65 years, with left ventricular ejection fraction >/= 50%, received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and underwent surgery at 10 different oncology centers in Turkiye between October 2016 and December 2022. The treatment arms were divided into 4-6 cycles of docetaxel/trastuzumab/pertuzumab for arm A, 4 cycles of adriamycin/cyclophosphamide followed by 4 cycles of taxane/TP for arm B. There were 50 patients (35.2%) in arm A and 92 patients (64.8%) in arm B. The median follow-up of all of the patients was 19.9 months (95% CI 17.5-22.3). The 3-year DFS rates for treatment arms A and B were 90.0% and 83.8%, respectively, and the survival outcomes between the groups were similar (p = 0.34). Furthermore, the pathologic complete response rates were similar in both treatment arms, at 50.0% and 51.1%, respectively (p = 0.90). This study supports shortened neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer, a common practice in some clinics.

    Title: Emergence of Quantum Dots as Innovative Tools for Early Diagnosis and Advanced Treatment of Breast Cancer.
    Authors: Diaz-Garcia D, Diaz-Sanchez M, Alvarez-Conde J, Gomez-Ruiz S
    Abstract: Quantum dots (QDs) semiconducting nanomaterials, have garnered attention due to their distinctive properties, including small size, high luminescence, and biocompatibility. In the context of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), notorious for its resistance to conventional treatments, QDs exhibit promising potential for enhancing diagnostic imaging and providing targeted therapies. This review underscores recent advancements in the utilization of QDs in imaging techniques, such as fluorescence tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, aiming at the early and precise detection of tumors. Emphasis is placed on the significance of QD design, synthesis and functionalization processes as well as their use in innovative strategies for targeted drug delivery, capitalizing on their ability to selectively deliver therapeutic agents to cancer cells. As the research in this field advances rapidly, this review covers a classification of QDs according to their composition, the characterization techniques than can be used to determine their properties and, subsequently, emphasizes recent findings in the field of TNBC-targeting, highlighting the imperative need to address challenges, like potential toxicity or methodologies standardization. Collectively, the findings explored thus far suggest that QDs could pave the way for early diagnosis and effective therapy of TNBC, representing a significant stride toward precise and personalized strategies in treating TNBC.

    Title: Effectiveness and safety of neoadjuvant therapy in triple-negative breast cancer in a real-world population.
    Authors: Galindo Garcia C, Diaz Acedo R, Artacho Criado S, Rodriguez de la Borbolla Artacho M
    Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Triple-negative breast cancer is a subtype of aggressive breast cancer. Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of neoadjuvant treatment in early-stage triple-negative breast cancer and to identify predictors of pathological complete response. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective study involving 79 patients with triple-negative breast cancer who initiated neoadjuvant treatment between January 2017 and October 2022. Descriptive analyses were performed as appropriate. Statistical analysis utilized bivariate logistic regression to explore the presence of factors related to pathological complete response, and the Kaplan-Meier method was employed for survival analysis. RESULTS: In the overall population, 27 patients (n=78; 34.6%) achieved pathological complete response in the breast and axillary lymph nodes, and 31 (n=73; 42.5%) achieved a grade 5 pathological complete response in the breast, according to the Miller and Payne classification. The addition of platinum to standard therapy improved both breast and axillary lymph node pathological complete response rates. Age less than 40 years was identified as a predictor of pathological complete response in our study population through bivariate analysis, while Ki67 levels lower than 70% were associated with a lower pathological complete response rate. Adverse events were reported in 72 patients (91.1%), with grade 3-5 adverse events observed in 33 (41.8%). There was a particularly notable increase in gastrointestinal and hematological adverse events when platinum was added. CONCLUSIONS: In this population, we observed moderate rates of pathological complete response with acceptable chemotherapy tolerance. Platinum-based chemotherapy appears to enhance the likelihood of achieving pathological complete response, albeit with a less favorable safety profile. Therefore, evaluating the benefit-risk balance is crucial when selecting the optimal chemotherapy regimen for individual patients.

    Title: Seed distribution stability in permanent breast seed implant brachytherapy.
    Authors: Zhang C, Northway C, Crook J, Hilts M, Batchelar D
    Abstract: PURPOSES: In this study we aim to quantitatively evaluate the stability of implanted seeds in permanent breast seed implant (PBSI) brachytherapy and assess any impact on treatment quality. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty-seven consecutive patients who received PBSI treatment at BC Cancer Kelowna from 2013 to 2021 with post-implant CT images available were included in this study. For each patient, two sets of post-implant CT scans were retrospectively analyzed: Day0, obtained immediately after implant, and Day30, obtained approximately one month following implant. Seed distributions were quantified using the 90% isodose contour, outlier seed maximum spread, and number of seeds located in the seroma as well as seroma quadrants. These were then compared between Day0 and Day30. Post-implant dosimetry of target volumes as well as critical structures were compared. RESULTS: The 90% isodose volume was found to decrease over time. All seeds remained in the breast region however the maximum spread of seeds increased in all directions from Day0 to Day30. All recorded target volume dosimetric parameters were, on average, lower on Day30 compared to Day0 but mean dosimetry levels still met clinical goals. Dose in critical structures was overall similar. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we quantitatively described the changes in seed distributions as well as dosimetry from Day0 to Day30 post PBSI procedure. We addressed concerns related to seed stability in breast tissue and provided clinical evidence on dosimetric efficacy of the PBSI technique.

    Title: Breast cancer risk assessment for prescription of Menopausal Hormone Therapy in women who have a family history of breast cancer.
    Authors: Huntley C, Torr B, Kavanaugh G, George A, Hanson H, Snape K, Broggio J, Glasgow L, Tischkowitz M, Evans DG, Antoniou AC, Turnbull C
    Abstract: Background Menopausal Hormone Therapy (MHT) can alleviate menopausal symptoms but is associated with increased risk of breast cancer (BC). MHT prescription should be preceded by individualised risk/benefit evaluation; however, data outlining the impact of family history alongside different MHT therapeutic approaches are lacking. Aim To quantify the risks associated with MHT use in women with varying BC family histories of i) developing and ii) dying from BC. Design and setting An epidemiological modelling study (UK women). Method We used i) background risks of BC by age and family history, ii) relative risks for BC associated with MHT use, and iii) 10-year BC-specific net mortality rates to model the risk of developing and dying from BC between the ages of 50 and 80 in women with four different BC family history profiles: 'average', 'modest', 'intermediate', and 'strong'. Results For a woman of 'average' family history taking no MHT, the cumulative BC risk (age 50-80) is 9.8%, and the risk of dying from the BC is 1.7%. Five years' exposure to combined-cyclical MHT (age 50-55) increases these risks to 11.0% and 1.8%, respectively. For a woman with a 'strong' family history taking no MHT, the cumulative BC risk is 19.6%, and the risk of dying is 3.2%. With 5 years of MHT (age 50-55), this increases to 22.4% and 3.5%. Conclusion Both family history and MHT are associated with increased risk of BC. Estimates of the risks associated with MHT for women with different family histories can support decision-making around MHT prescription.

    Title: Circadian tumor infiltration and function of CD8(+) T cells dictate immunotherapy efficacy.
    Authors: Wang C, Zeng Q, Gul ZM, Wang S, Pick R, Cheng P, Bill R, Wu Y, Naulaerts S, Barnoud C, Hsueh PC, Moller SH, Cenerenti M, Sun M, Su Z, Jemelin S, Petrenko V, Dibner C, Hugues S, Jandus C, Li Z, Michielin O, Ho PC, Garg AD, Simonetta F, Pittet MJ, Scheiermann C
    Abstract: The quality and quantity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, particularly CD8(+) T cells, are important parameters for the control of tumor growth and response to immunotherapy. Here, we show in murine and human cancers that these parameters exhibit circadian oscillations, driven by both the endogenous circadian clock of leukocytes and rhythmic leukocyte infiltration, which depends on the circadian clock of endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment. To harness these rhythms therapeutically, we demonstrate that efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy and immune checkpoint blockade can be improved by adjusting the time of treatment during the day. Furthermore, time-of-day-dependent T cell signatures in murine tumor models predict overall survival in patients with melanoma and correlate with response to anti-PD-1 therapy. Our data demonstrate the functional significance of circadian dynamics in the tumor microenvironment and suggest the importance of leveraging these features for improving future clinical trial design and patient care.

    Title: Development of a reliable cell-based reporter gene assay to measure the bioactivity of anti-HER2 therapeutic antibodies.
    Authors: Zhao X, Qian W, Hou S, Wu Y, Guo H, Xu J, Zhang D, Li J, Fu R, Xu M, Wang F
    Abstract: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a key player in the pathogenesis and progression of breast cancer and is currently a primary target for breast cancer immunotherapy. Bioactivity determination is necessary to guarantee the safety and efficacy of therapeutic antibodies targeting HER2. Nevertheless, currently available bioassays for measuring the bioactivity of anti-HER2 mAbs are either not representative or have high variability. Here, we established a reliable reporter gene assay (RGA) based on T47D-SRE-Luc cell line that expresses endogenous HER2 and luciferase controlled by serum response element (SRE) to measure the bioactivity of anti-HER2 antibodies. Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) can lead to the heterodimerization of HER2 on the cell membrane and induce the expression of downstream SRE-controlled luciferase, while pertuzumab can dose-dependently reverse the reaction, resulting in a good dose-response curve reflecting the activity of the antibody. After optimizing the relevant assay parameters, the established RGA was fully validated based on ICH-Q2 (R1), which demonstrated that the method had excellent specificity, accuracy, precision, linearity, and stability. In summary, this robust and innovative bioactivity determination assay can be applied in the development and screening, release control, biosimilar assessment and stability studies of anti-HER2 mAbs.

    Title: The procoagulant signature of cancer cells drives fibrin network formation in tumor microenvironment and impacts its quality. Implications in cancer cell migration and the resistance to anticancer agents.
    Authors: Tran HCM, Mbemba E, Mourot N, Faltas B, Rousseau A, Lefkou E, Sabbah M, van Dreden P, Gerotziafas G
    Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Cancer cells induce hypercoagulability in the tumoral microenvironment by expressing Tissue Factor (TF). We aimed to study the impact of the procoagulant signature of cancer cells on the quality and structure of fibrin network. We also studied the impact of fibrin clot shield (FCS) on the efficiency of anticancer agents and the migration of cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pancreatic cancer cells BXPC3 and breast cancer cells MDA-MB231 and MCF7, were cultured in the presence of normal Platelet Poor Plasma (PPP), diluted 10 % in conditioning media. Their potential to induce thrombin generation and their fibrinolytic activity were assessed. The structure of fibrin network was analyzed with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Cancer cells' mobility with fibrin clot and their interactions with fibrin were observed. Cancer cells were treated with paclitaxel (PTX) or 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4OHTam) in the presence or absence of FCS. RESULTS: Cancer cells, in presence of PPP, induced fibrin network formation. High TF-expressing cancer cells (BXPC3 and MDA-MB23 cells), led to dense fibrin network with fine fibers. Low TF expressing cells MCF7 led to thick fibers. Exogenous TF enhanced the density of fibrin network formed by MCF7 cells. Cancer cells through their inherent profibrinolytic potential migrated within the fiber scaffold. The BXPC3 and MCF7 cells moved in clusters whereas the MDA-MB231 cells moved individually within the fibrin network. FCS decreased the efficiency of PTX and 4OHTam on the viability of cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: The procoagulant signature of cancer cells is determinant for the quality and structure of fibrin network in the microenvironment. Original SEM images show the architecture of "bird's nest"-like fibrin network being in touch with the cell membranes and surrounding cancer cells. Fibrin network constructed by triggering thrombin generation by cancer cells, provides a scaffold for cell migration. Fibrin clot shields protect cancer cells against PTX and 4OHTam.

    Authors: Abdulwahid Mohammad Noor K, Mohd Norsuddin N, Che Isa IN, Abdul Karim MK
    Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Breast imaging plays a crucial role in the early detection and management of breast cancer, with visual quality, modality innovation and diagnostic performance being key factors in achieving accurate diagnoses and optimal patient outcomes. This paper presents a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of the literature on the three above elements focusing on breast imaging, aiming to uncover publication trends, identify influential works and authors, and highlight future research directions. METHODS: We employed a methodical bibliometric approach, making use of Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases for gathering literatures. We planned our search strategy, concentrating on terms linked to "breast imaging," "image quality," and "diagnostic accuracy" to ensure a systematic examination of the subject. The enhanced search functions in these databases enabled us to narrow down and improve our findings, choosing only the articles, conference papers, and book sections that are most relevant. After conducting a thorough screening process to remove duplicates and evaluate significance, we utilized ScientoPy and VOSviewer software for an in-depth bibliometric analysis. This helped to explore trends in publications, patterns of citations, and thematic groups, giving us a better understanding of how the field has changed and where it currently stands. Our approach prioritized assessing methodological quality and bias in the studies we included, guaranteeing the reliability of our findings. RESULTS: We reviewed 2984 relevant publications, revealing a consistent annual growth rate of 2.8% in breast imaging research, with the United States and Europe leading in contributions. The study found that advancements in radiological technologies and international collaboration are driving forces behind the field's expansion. Key subject areas such as 'Radiology, Nuclear Medicine, and Medical Imaging' dominated, underscoring their impact on diagnostic quality. Notable authors and institutions have been identified for their influential research, characterized by high citation metrics and significant scholarly impact. CONCLUSION: The study shows a continuous increase in research on breast imaging, considered by new technologies and teamwork defining the present time. The assessment highlights a key move towards utilizing digital imaging methods and computational analysis, affecting the improvement of future diagnostic procedures and patients' results. The study highlights the importance of continued international collaborations to tackle the new barriers in breast imaging and make the most of technological progress. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study shows a focus on using interdisciplinary methods and cutting-edge technology in breast imaging to help healthcare professionals improve their performance and accuracy in diagnosis. Recognizing vital research and emerging trends should guide clinical guidelines, radiology training, and patient care plans to encourage the use of effective techniques and stimulate innovation in diagnostic approaches.

    Title: Deep learning-assisted monitoring of trastuzumab efficacy in HER2-Overexpressing breast cancer via SERS immunoassays of tumor-derived urinary exosomal biomarkers.
    Authors: Kim J, Son HY, Lee S, Rho HW, Kim R, Jeong H, Park C, Mun B, Moon Y, Jeong E, Lim EK, Haam S
    Abstract: Monitoring drug efficacy is significant in the current concept of companion diagnostics in metastatic breast cancer. Trastuzumab, a drug targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), is an effective treatment for metastatic breast cancer. However, some patients develop resistance to this therapy; therefore, monitoring its efficacy is essential. Here, we describe a deep learning-assisted monitoring of trastuzumab efficacy based on a surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) immunoassay against HER2-overexpressing mouse urinary exosomes. Individual Raman reporters bearing the desired SERS tag and exosome capture substrate were prepared for the SERS immunoassay; SERS tag signals were collected to prepare deep learning training data. Using this deep learning algorithm, various complicated mixtures of SERS tags were successfully quantified and classified. Exosomal antigen levels of five types of cell-derived exosomes were determined using SERS-deep learning analysis and compared with those obtained via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. Finally, drug efficacy was monitored via SERS-deep learning analysis using urinary exosomes from trastuzumab-treated mice. Use of this monitoring system should allow proactive responses to any treatment-resistant issues.

    Title: Differing Content and Language Based on Poster-Patient Relationships on the Chinese Social Media Platform Weibo: Text Classification, Sentiment Analysis, and Topic Modeling of Posts on Breast Cancer.
    Authors: Zhang Z, Liew K, Kuijer R, She WJ, Yada S, Wakamiya S, Aramaki E
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Breast cancer affects the lives of not only those diagnosed but also the people around them. Many of those affected share their experiences on social media. However, these narratives may differ according to who the poster is and what their relationship with the patient is; a patient posting about their experiences may post different content from someone whose friends or family has breast cancer. Weibo is 1 of the most popular social media platforms in China, and breast cancer-related posts are frequently found there. OBJECTIVE: With the goal of understanding the different experiences of those affected by breast cancer in China, we aimed to explore how content and language used in relevant posts differ according to who the poster is and what their relationship with the patient is and whether there are differences in emotional expression and topic content if the patient is the poster themselves or a friend, family member, relative, or acquaintance. METHODS: We used Weibo as a resource to examine how posts differ according to the different poster-patient relationships. We collected a total of 10,322 relevant Weibo posts. Using a 2-step analysis method, we fine-tuned 2 Chinese Robustly Optimized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) Pretraining Approach models on this data set with annotated poster-patient relationships. These models were lined in sequence, first a binary classifier (no_patient or patient) and then a multiclass classifier (post_user, family_members, friends_relatives, acquaintances, heard_relation), to classify poster-patient relationships. Next, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count lexicon to conduct sentiment analysis from 5 emotion categories (positive and negative emotions, anger, sadness, and anxiety), followed by topic modeling (BERTopic). RESULTS: Our binary model (F(1)-score=0.92) and multiclass model (F(1)-score=0.83) were largely able to classify poster-patient relationships accurately. Subsequent sentiment analysis showed significant differences in emotion categories across all poster-patient relationships. Notably, negative emotions and anger were higher for the "no_patient" class, but sadness and anxiety were higher for the "family_members" class. Focusing on the top 30 topics, we also noted that topics on fears and anger toward cancer were higher in the "no_patient" class, but topics on cancer treatment were higher in the "family_members" class. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese users post different types of content, depending on the poster- poster-patient relationships. If the patient is family, posts are sadder and more anxious but also contain more content on treatments. However, if no patient is detected, posts show higher levels of anger. We think that these may stem from rants from posters, which may help with emotion regulation and gathering social support.

    Abstract: PURPOSE: Breast cancer mortality rates in Latin America (LA) are higher than those in the United States, possibly because of advanced disease presentation, health care disparities, or unfavorable molecular subtypes. The Latin American Cancer Research Network was established to address these challenges and to promote collaborative clinical research. The Molecular Profiling of Breast Cancer Study (MPBCS) aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of LA participants with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The MPBCS enrolled 1,449 participants from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Uruguay. Through harmonized procedures and quality assurance measures, this study evaluated clinicopathologic characteristics, neoadjuvant chemotherapy response, and survival outcomes according to residual cancer burden (RCB) and the type of surgery. RESULTS: Overall, 711 and 480 participants in the primary surgery and neoadjuvant arms, respectively, completed the 5-year follow-up period. Overall survival was independently associated with RCB (worse survival for RCBIII-adjusted hazard ratio, 8.19, P < .001, and RCBII [adjusted hazard ratio, 3.69, P < .008] compared with RCB0 [pathologic complete response or pCR]) and type of surgery (worse survival in mastectomy than in breast-conserving surgery [BCS], adjusted hazard ratio, 2.97, P = .001). The hormone receptor-negative-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive group had the highest proportion of pCR (48.9%). The analysis of the ASCO Quality Oncology Practice Initiative breast module revealed high compliance with pathologic standards but lower adherence to treatment administration standards. Notably, compliance with trastuzumab administration varied widely among countries (33.3%-88.7%). CONCLUSION: In LABC, we demonstrated the survival benefit of BCS and the prognostic effect of the response to available neoadjuvant treatments despite an important variability in access to key treatments. The MPBCS represents a significant step forward in understanding the real-world implementation of oncologic procedures in LA.

    Title: Cognitive impairment following breast cancer treatments: an umbrella review.
    Authors: Oliva G, Giustiniani A, Danesin L, Burgio F, Arcara G, Conte P
    Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) refers to a cognitive decline associated with cancer or its treatments. While research into CRCI is expanding, evidence remains scattered due to differences in study designs, methodologies, and definitions. The present umbrella review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current evidence regarding the impact of different breast cancer therapies on cognitive functioning, with a particular focus on the interplay among objective cognitive deficits (ie, measured with standardized tests), subjective cognitive concerns, (ie, self-reported), and other mediating psycho-physical factors. METHODS: The search was made in Pubmed, Embase, and Scopus for articles published until July 2023, following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis protocol. RESULTS: Chemotherapy and endocrine therapy appear consistently associated with CRCI in patients with breast cancer, primarily affecting memory, attention/concentration, executive functioning, and processing speed. Subjective cognitive concerns were often found weakly or not associated with neuropsychological test results, while overall CRCI seemed consistently associated with psychological distress, fatigue, sleep quality, and inflammatory and biological factors. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that CRCI is common after chemotherapy and endocrine therapy for breast cancer. However, heterogeneity in study designs and the scarcity of studies on more recent treatments such as targeted therapies and immunotherapies, highlight the need for more systematic and harmonized studies, possibly taking into account the complex and multifactorial etiology of CRCI. This may provide valuable insights into CRCI's underlying mechanisms and potential new ways to treat it.

    Title: In silico identification of a novel Cdc2-like kinase 2 (CLK2) inhibitor in triple negative breast cancer.
    Authors: Huang CC, Hsu CM, Chao MW, Hsu KC, Lin TE, Yen SC, Tu HJ, Pan SL
    Abstract: Dysregulation of RNA splicing processes is intricately linked to tumorigenesis in various cancers, especially breast cancer. Cdc2-like kinase 2 (CLK2), an oncogenic RNA-splicing kinase pivotal in breast cancer, plays a significant role, particularly in the context of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a subtype marked by substantial medical challenges due to its low survival rates. In this study, we employed a structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) method to identify potential CLK2 inhibitors with novel chemical structures for treating TNBC. Compound 670551 emerged as a novel CLK2 inhibitor with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) value of 619.7 nM. Importantly, Compound 670551 exhibited high selectivity for CLK2 over other protein kinases. Functionally, this compound significantly reduced the survival and proliferation of TNBC cells. Results from a cell-based assay demonstrated that this inhibitor led to a decrease in RNA splicing proteins, such as SRSF4 and SRSF6, resulting in cell apoptosis. In summary, we identified a novel CLK2 inhibitor as a promising potential treatment for TNBC therapy.

    Title: Declination of Treatment, Racial and Ethnic Disparity, and Overall Survival in US Patients With Breast Cancer.
    Authors: Freeman JQ, Li JL, Fisher SG, Yao KA, David SP, Huo D
    Abstract: IMPORTANCE: Declining treatment negatively affects health outcomes among patients with cancer. Limited research has investigated national trends of and factors associated with treatment declination or its association with overall survival (OS) among patients with breast cancer. OBJECTIVES: To examine trends and racial and ethnic disparities in treatment declination and racial and ethnic OS differences stratified by treatment decision in US patients with breast cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cross-sectional study used data for patients with breast cancer from the 2004 to 2020 National Cancer Database. Four treatment modalities were assessed: chemotherapy, hormone therapy (HT), radiotherapy, and surgery. The chemotherapy cohort included patients with stage I to IV disease. The HT cohort included patients with stage I to IV hormone receptor-positive disease. The radiotherapy and surgery cohorts included patients with stage I to III disease. Data were analyzed from March to November 2023. EXPOSURE: Race and ethnicity and other sociodemographic and clinicopathologic characteristics. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Treatment decision, categorized as received or declined, was modeled using logistic regression. OS was modeled using Cox regression. Models were controlled for year of initial diagnosis, age, sex, health insurance, median household income, facility type, Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score, histology, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, molecular subtype, and tumor grade. RESULTS: The study included 2 837 446 patients (mean [SD] age, 61.6 [13.4] years; 99.1% female), with 1.7% American Indian, Alaska Native, or other patients; 3.5% Asian or Pacific Islander patients; 11.2% Black patients; 5.6% Hispanic patients; and 78.0% White patients. Of 1 296 488 patients who were offered chemotherapy, 124 721 (9.6%) declined; 99 276 of 1 635 916 patients (6.1%) declined radiotherapy; 94 363 of 1 893 339 patients (5.0%) declined HT; and 15 846 of 2 590 963 patients (0.6%) declined surgery. Compared with White patients, American Indian, Alaska Native, or other patients (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.47; 95% CI, 1.26-1.72), Asian or Pacific Islander patients (AOR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.15-1.44), and Black patients (AOR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.89-2.14) were more likely to decline surgery; American Indian, Alaska Native, or other patients (AOR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.05-1.21) and Asian or Pacific Islander patients (AOR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.16-1.27) were more likely to decline chemotherapy; and Black patients were more likely to decline radiotherapy (AOR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.08). Asian or Pacific Islander patients (AOR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.77-0.85), Black patients (AOR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.83-0.89), and Hispanic patients (AOR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.63-0.69) were less likely to decline HT. Furthermore, Black patients who declined chemotherapy had a higher mortality risk than White patients (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02-1.13), while there were no OS differences between Black and White patients who declined HT (AHR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.97-1.13) or radiotherapy (AHR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92-1.04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cross-sectional study highlights racial and ethnic disparities in treatment declination and OS, suggesting the need for equity-focused interventions, such as patient education on treatment benefits and improved patient-clinician communication and shared decision-making, to reduce disparities and improve patient survival.

    Title: Targeting resistant breast cancer stem cells in a three-dimensional culture model with oleuropein encapsulated in methacrylated alginate microparticles.
    Authors: Altundag-Erdogan O, Tutar R, Yuce E, Celebi-Saltik B
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of cancer cells that are believed to be responsible for tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, and resistance to conventional therapies. Oleuropein as a natural compound found in olive leaves and olive oil, has potential therapeutic effects in cancer treatment, particularly in targeting CSCs. It induces apoptosis in CSCs while sparing normal cells, inhibit proliferation, migration, and invasion, and suppress the self-renewal ability of CSCs. Additionally, oleuropein has shown synergistic effects with conventional chemotherapy drugs, enhancing their efficacy against CSCs. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to selectively target therapeutically resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs) within a heterogeneous tumor population by utilizing oleuropein (OLE) encapsulated in methacrylated alginate (OLE-mALG) within an in vivo-like microenvironment. PURPOSE: This study aims to target therapeutically resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs) with oleuropein (OLE) encapsulated in the methacrylated alginate (OLE-mALG) in a heterogeneous tumor population with an in vivo-like microenvironment. METHODS: Co-culture of CSCs with non-tumorogenic MCF-12 A cells was performed, the 3D breast cancer model was supported with methocel/matrigel/collagen-I, and vascularization was ensured with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Then, OLE-loaded methacrylated alginate microparticles (mALG) were formed by dual crosslinking in the presence of both ionic and visible light obtained with a droplet based microfluidic system. The characterization and effectiveness of the produced OLE-mALG were evaluated by the FTIR, swelling/degradation/release analysis. Before producing OLE loaded mALG microparticles, a preliminary study was carried out to determine the effective dose of OLE for cells and the duration of OLE action on MCF-7, CSCs and MCF-12 A. Subsequently, CSC viability (WST-1), apoptosis (Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3, caspase-9), stemness (OCT3/4, NANOG, SOX2), EMT profile (E-cadherin, Vimentin, Slug) and proliferation (SURVIVIN, p21, CYCLIN D1) after OLE-mALG treatment were all evaluated in the 3D model. RESULTS: OLE was encapsulated in mALG with an efficiency of 90.49% and released 73% within 7 h. OLE-mALG induced apoptosis through the decrease in anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and an increase in pro-apoptotic Bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9 protein levels. While Vimentin and Slug protein levels decreased after 200 microg/mL OLE-mALG treatment to 3D breast cancer culture, E-cadherin levels increased. OLE-mALG treatment to CSC co-culture led to a decrease in proliferation by triggering p21/SURVIVIN expressions, and also resulted in an increase in stemness genes (OCT3/4/NANOG/SOX2). CONCLUSION: 200 microg/mL OLE-loaded mALG microparticles suppressed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by suppressing Vimentin and Slug protein levels, and increased E-cadherin levels in the 3D breast cancer model we created with CSCs, MCF-12 A and HUVECs. This complex system may allow the use of personalized cells for rapid drug screening in preclinical studies compared to animal experiments. OLE-mALG showed apoptotic and metastasis suppressive properties in cancer cells and it was concluded that it can be used in combination with or alternatively with chemotherapeutic agents to target breast cancer stem cells.

    Title: Non-pharmacological treatments for anticipatory nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the Clinical Practice Guidelines for Antiemesis 2023.
    Authors: Kobayashi M, Kako J, Iba A, Okuyama A, Ozawa K, Abe M, Wada M, Akechi T, Iihara H, Imamura CK, Kim YI, Sasaki H, Satomi E, Takeda M, Tanaka R, Nakajima TE, Nakamura N, Nishimura J, Noda M, Hayashi K, Higashi T, Boku N, Matsumoto K, Matsumoto Y, Okita K, Yamamoto N, Aogi K, Iino K
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Anticipatory chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a conditioned response influenced by the severity and duration of previous emetic responses to chemotherapy. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of non-pharmacologic interventions for anticipatory CINV among patients with cancer. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search in databases, including PubMed, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and Ichushi-Web, from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 2020. Randomized controlled trials, non-randomized designs, observational studies, or case-control studies that utilized non-pharmacological therapies were included. The primary outcomes were anticipatory CINV, with an additional investigation into adverse events and the costs of therapies. The risk-of-bias for each study was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool, and meta-analysis was performed using Revman 5.4 software. RESULTS: Of the 107 studies identified, six met the inclusion criteria. Three types of non-pharmacological treatments were identified: systematic desensitization (n = 2), hypnotherapy (n = 2), and yoga therapy (n = 2). Among them, systematic desensitization significantly improved anticipatory CINV as compared to that in the control group (nausea: risk ratio [RR] = 0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.49-0.72, p < 0.00001; vomiting: RR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.32-0.91, p = 0.02). However, heterogeneity in outcome measures precluded meta-analysis for hypnotherapy and yoga. Additionally, most selected studies had a high or unclear risk of bias, and adverse events were not consistently reported. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that systematic desensitization may effectively reduce anticipatory CINV. However, further research is warranted before implementation in clinical settings.

    Title: The analysis of transcriptomic signature of TNBC-searching for the potential RNA-based predictive biomarkers to determine the chemotherapy sensitivity.
    Authors: Stanislaw S, Pawel K, Maria S, Lukasz L, Dorota K, Rafal M, Piotr K, Mariola A, Adam M, Ewelina I, Izabela L
    Abstract: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is the foundation treatment for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and frequently results in pathological complete response (pCR). However, there are large differences in clinical response and survival after neoadjuvant chemotherapy of TNBC patients. The aim was to identify genes whose expression significantly associates with the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with TNBC. Transcriptomes of 46 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples from TNBC patients were analyzed by RNA-seq by comparing 26 TNBCs with pCR versus 20 TNBCs with pathological partial remission (pPR). Subsequently, we narrowed down the list of genes to those that strongly correlated with drug sensitivity of 63 breast cancer cell lines based on Dependency Map Consortium data re-analysis. Furthermore, the list of genes was limited to those presenting specific expression in breast tumor cells as revealed in three large published single-cell RNA-seq breast cancer datasets. Finally, we analyzed which of the selected genes were significantly associated with overall survival (OS) in TNBC TCGA dataset. A total of 105 genes were significantly differentially expressed in comparison between pPR versus pCR. As revealed by PLSR analysis in breast cancer cell lines, out of 105 deregulated genes, 42 were associated with sensitivity to docetaxel, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and/or cyclophosphamide. We found that 24 out of 42 sensitivity-associated genes displayed intermediate or strong expression in breast malignant cells using single-cell RNAseq re-analysis. Finally, 10 out of 24 genes were significantly associated with overall survival in TNBC TCGA dataset. Our RNA-seq-based findings suggest that there might be transcriptomic signature consisted of 24 genes specifically expressed in tumor malignant cells for predicting neoadjuvant response in FFPE samples from TNBC patients prior to treatment initiation. Additionally, nine out of 24 genes were potential survival predictors in TNBC. This group of 24 genes should be further investigated for its potential to be translated into a predictive test(s).

    Title: Long-term prospective outcome data using EndoPredict as risk stratification and chemotherapy decision biomarker in hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative early breast cancer.
    Authors: Klein E, Kiechle M, Josipovic A, Anders SI, Noske A, Mogler C, Hapfelmeier A, Ettl J
    Abstract: PURPOSE: To report the prospective long-term outcome data of patients whose chemotherapy decision was guided by the EndoPredict test. METHODS: Patients with hormone receptor-positive HER2-negative early breast cancer with 0-3 positive lymph nodes were enrolled. The EndoPredict test was carried out on all tumor samples. Treatment compliance, local recurrence, distant metastases, and survival were evaluated. Associations of EPclin risk stratification with 5-year disease-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival were evaluated by time-to-event analysis. RESULTS: 368 consecutive patients were included in the analysis. Median follow-up was 8.2 years. EndoPredict allocated 238 (65%) in the low-risk and 130 (35%) patients in the high-risk group. Risk for disease recurrence or death in EPclin high-risk patients was twofold higher than in EPclin low-risk patients (hazard ratio [HR] 2.08; 95% CI 1.26-3.44; p = 0.004). EPclin low-risk patients had a 5-year disease-free survival of 95.3% (95% CI 92.6-98.0%). EPclin high-risk patients were at higher risk of developing distant metastases or death (HR 2.21; 95% CI 1.27-3.88; p = 0.005). EPclin high-risk patients who underwent chemotherapy had a 5-year DFS of 89.1% (95% CI 82.7-96.1%) in contrast to high-risk patients without chemotherapy (68.9%; 95% CI 56.2-84.5%; HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.23-0.95; p = 0.036). EPclin high-risk patients were at higher risk of experiencing distant metastases or death than EPclin low-risk patients regardless of menopausal status (premenopausal: HR 3.55; 95% CI 1.17-12.32; p = 0.025; postmenopausal: HR 1.92; 95% CI 0.99-3.7; p = 0.054). CONCLUSION: EndoPredict can guide decisions on adjuvant chemotherapy in early luminal breast cancer. EndoPredict risk stratification is also applicable in premenopausal women.

    Title: The combination of breast cancer PDO and mini-PDX platform for drug screening and individualized treatment.
    Authors: Cui Y, Ran R, Da Y, Zhang H, Jiang M, Qi X, Zhang W, Niu L, Zhou Y, Zhou C, Tang X, Wang K, Yan Y, Ren Y, Dong D, Zhou Y, Wang H, Gong J, Hu F, Zhao S, Zhang H, Zhang C, Yang J
    Abstract: The majority of advanced breast cancers exhibit strong aggressiveness, heterogeneity, and drug resistance, and currently, the lack of effective treatment strategies is one of the main challenges that cancer research must face. Therefore, developing a feasible preclinical model to explore tailored treatments for refractory breast cancer is urgently needed. We established organoid biobanks from 17 patients with breast cancer and characterized them by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and next generation sequencing (NGS). In addition, we in the first combination of patient-derived organoids (PDOs) with mini-patient-derived xenografts (Mini-PDXs) for the rapid and precise screening of drug sensitivity. We confirmed that breast cancer organoids are a high-fidelity three-dimension (3D) model in vitro that recapitulates the original tumour's histological and genetic features. In addition, for a heavily pretreated patient with advanced drug-resistant breast cancer, we combined PDO and Mini-PDX models to identify potentially effective combinations of therapeutic agents for this patient who were alpelisib + fulvestrant. In the drug sensitivity experiment of organoids, we observed changes in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling axis and oestrogen receptor (ER) protein expression levels, which further verified the reliability of the screening results. Our study demonstrates that the PDO combined with mini-PDX model offers a rapid and precise drug screening platform that holds promise for personalized medicine, improving patient outcomes and addressing the urgent need for effective therapies in advanced breast cancer.

    Authors: Ryad N, Elmaaty AA, M Ibrahim I, Ahmed Maghrabi AH, Yahya Alahdal MA, Saleem RM, Zaki I, Ghany LMAA
    Abstract: Aim: Using molecular hybridization approach, novel 18 quinoline derivatives (6a-11) were designed and synthesized as EGFR-TK inhibitors. Materials & methods: The antiproliferative activity was assessed against breast (MCF-7), leukemia (HL-60) and lung (A549) cancer cell lines. Moreover, the most active quinoline derivatives (6d and 8b) were further investigated for their potential as EGFR-TK inhibitors. In addition, cell cycle analysis and apoptosis induction activity were conducted. Results: A considerable cytotoxic activity was attained with IC(50) values spanning from 0.06 to 1.12 muM. Besides, the quinoline derivatives 6d and 8b displayed potent inhibitory activity against EFGR with IC(50) values of 0.18 and 0.08 muM, respectively. Conclusion: Accordingly, the afforded quinoline derivatives can be used as promising lead anticancer candidates for future optimization.

    Title: Clinicopathologic and molecular correlates to neoadjuvant chemotherapy-induced pathologic response in breast angiosarcoma.
    Authors: Chang HY, Dermawan JK, Kuba MG, Crago AM, Singer S, Tap W, Chi P, D'Angelo S, Rosenbaum E, Antonescu CR
    Abstract: Both primary and secondary breast angiosarcoma (AS) are characterized by multifocal presentation and aggressive behavior. Despite multimodality therapy, local and distant relapse rates remain high. Therefore, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is employed to improve the R0 resection rates and survival, but its benefits remain controversial. Herein, we investigate pathologic and molecular correlates to NACT-induced histologic response in a group of 29 breast AS, 4 primary and 25 radiation-associated (RA). The two NACT regimens applied were anthracycline- and non-anthracycline-based. The pathologic response grade was defined as: I: </= 50%, II: 51%-90%, III: 91%-99%, and IV: 100%. An additional 45 primary AS and 102 RA-AS treated by surgery alone were included for survival comparison. The genomic landscape was analyzed in a subset of cases and compared to a cohort of AS without NACT on a paired tumor-normal targeted DNA NGS platform. All patients were females, with a median age of 31 years in primary AS and 68 years in RA-AS. All surgical margins were negative in NACT group. The NACT response was evenly divided between poor (Grades I-II; n = 15) and good responders (Grades III-IV; n = 14). Mitotic count >10/mm(2) was the only factor inversely associated with pathologic response. By targeted NGS, all 10 post-NACT RA-AS demonstrated MYC amplification, while both primary AS harbored KDR mutations. TMB or other genomic alterations did not correlate with pathologic response. All four patients with Grade IV response remained free of disease. The good responders had a significantly better disease-specific survival (p = 0.04). There was no survival difference with NACT status or the NACT regimens applied. However, NACT patients with MYC-amplified tumors showed better disease-free survival (p = 0.04) compared to MYC-amplified patients without NACT. The overall survival of NACT group correlated with size >10 cm (p = 0.02), pathologic response (p = 0.04), and multifocality (p = 0.01) by univariate, while only size >10 cm (p = 0.03) remained significant by multivariate analysis.

    Title: Homeopathy as Praxis: Integration of Homeopathy as Supportive Care into Daily Life in Early Breast Cancer Patients.
    Authors: Veyrier CA, Roucoux G, Baumann-Coblentz L, Massol J, Karp JC, Wagner JP, Chassany O, Duracinsky M
    Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Homeopathy is one of most widely used non-conventional supportive care methods used by women with breast cancer. This article aims to describe the routines and practices related to homeopathy as supportive care used by women with non-metastatic breast cancer in France. METHODS: This qualitative study used Grounded Theory. Participants were women with early breast cancer and healthcare professionals (General Practitioner homeopaths & oncologists). Inclusion depended on specific criteria and the aim of theoretical sampling until data saturation. Data were collected through individual semi-structured interviews and focus groups following evolving topic guides. Transcribed interviews underwent in-depth thematic analysis. Inclusion, interviewing, transcription and coding occurred iteratively. Data was reported according to COREQ guidelines. RESULTS: The therapeutic agency of homeopathy was distributed to different actors and ritualized material activities highly involving the patient. The choice of remedy was mostly delegated by patients to General Practitioner homeopaths (GPH) during consultations. Individualization, that is to say adaptation to the patient, differed from other modes of access to homeopathy (self-medication and oncologists). Self-medication was mostly limited to known products in a limited time frame. However, we identified a supported self-medication using trusted homeopathic protocols. Following homeopathic prescriptions involves a high level of commitment on behalf of the patient and follows different rules for homeopathy intake. This knowledge was either acquired earlier for users or discovered along breast cancer treatment for non-users. Taking homeopathy involved small daily actions for intake of different products at different times of the day. New users used strategies to ease the integration of homeopathy into their daily life. The stance toward such rules differed among patients. Some followed rules to optimize their effects while others simplified the rules and took those rituals as part of homeopathy benefits. CONCLUSION: Homeopathy as supportive care in breast cancer is distributed toward different actors and ritualized activities. Homeopathy is a supported practice where GPH played a role in the prescription. Health Literacy in homeopathy played a role to ease its integration into daily life and identify the potential benefits. The high involvement of patients in their homeopathic treatment is a form of treatment reappropriation and empowerment.

    Title: Mitochondrial calcium overload contributes to cannabinoid-induced paraptosis in hormone-responsive breast cancer cells.
    Authors: de la Harpe A, Beukes N, Frost C
    Abstract: Studies have shown that natural products can induce paraptosis in tumour cell lines. Paraptosis is characterized by cytoplasmic vacuolation arising from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. The mechanism of paraptosis is unclear; however, dysregulation of Ca(2+) homeostasis is believed to affect paraptosis induction. This study investigated the mechanism of cell death induced by a phytocannabinoid ratio in the MCF7 breast cancer cell line. The crystal violet assay was used to detect changes in viability and morphology changes were investigated using light and transmission electron microscopy. Various inhibitors, fluorescent staining with high-content screening, and Western blot analysis were used to investigate different cell death mechanisms. The phytocannabinoid ratio induced significant cell death and cytoplasmic vacuolation in MCF7 cells; however, no apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy, or ferroptosis was detected. Vacuolation induced by phytocannabinoid treatment was inhibited by cycloheximide, suggesting paraptosis induction. The mechanism of paraptosis induction was investigated, and it was found that treatment (1) induced ER dilation and mitochondrial swelling, (2) induced significant ER stress and mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload and dysfunction, which appeared to be mediated by the voltage-dependent anion channel, and (3) significantly impaired all mitochondrial metabolic pathways. The data demonstrated that paraptosis induced by the cannabinoid ratio was mediated by Ca(2+) flux from the ER to the mitochondria. These findings highlight a novel mechanism of cannabinoid-induced cell death and emphasize the anti-cancer potential of cannabinoid ratios, which exhibited enhanced effects compared to individual cannabinoids.

    Title: Nobiletin Inhibits Breast Cancer Stem Cell by Regulating the Cell Cycle: A Comprehensive Bioinformatics Analysis and In Vitro Experiments.
    Authors: Hermawan A, Ikawati M, Putri DDP, Fatimah N, Prasetio HH
    Abstract: Inhibiting breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) signaling pathways is a strategic method for successfully treating breast cancer. Nobiletin (NOB) is a compound widely found in orange peel that exhibits a toxic effect on various types of cancer cells, and inhibits the signaling pathways that regulate the properties of BCSCs; however, the effects of NOB on BCSCs remain elusive. The purpose of this study was to determine the target genes of NOB for inhibiting BCSCs using in vitro three-dimensional breast cancer cell culture (mammospheres) and in silico approaches. We combined in vitro experiments to develop mammospheres and conducted cytotoxicity, next-generation sequencing, and bioinformatics analyses, such as gene ontology, the Reactome pathway enrichment, network topology, gene set enrichment analysis, hub genes selection, genetic alterations, prognostic value related to the mRNA expression, and mRNA and protein expression of potential NOB target genes that inhibit BCSCs. Here, we show that NOB inhibited BCSCs in mammospheres from MCF-7 cells. We also identified CDC6, CHEK1, BRCA1, UCHL5, TOP2A, MTMR4, and EXO1 as potential NOB targets inhibiting BCSCs. NOB decreased G0/G1, but increased the G2/M cell population. These findings showed that NOB is a potential therapeutic candidate for BCSCs treatment by regulating cell cycle.

    Title: Bilateral breast tuberculosis: A case report.
    Authors: Molla YD, Iberahim MA, Alemu HT, Abera SA
    Abstract: KEY CLINICAL MESSAGE: Breast tuberculosis is a rare clinical condition that has the potential to imitate breast cancer or pyogenic abscess. It is crucial to consider this in patients who have resistant breast abscesses or persistent sinuses, particularly in high-risk groups or locations. The main treatment for breast tuberculosis is antitubercular treatment. ABSTRACT: Bilateral breast tuberculosis is a rare form of the disease that affects breasts. It is most commonly seen in young females, including nulliparous and lactating women. Diagnosis of bilateral breast tuberculosis can be challenging due to its similarity to other breast diseases, such as granulomatous mastitis and breast carcinoma. Patients from high-risk groups and/or endemic locations who present with clinically suspicious breast lumps or refractory breast abscesses should have breast TB taken into consideration in their differential diagnosis. A 24-year-old Ethiopian female presented to the surgical outpatient department with a complaint of bilateral breast pain of 1-year duration associated with a low-grade fever, not associated with chills or rigor. She also has ulceration on the lower part of both breasts. It was followed by pus discharge from the right breast 6 months later. Investigations, including fine needle aspiration cytology, were suggestive of tuberculous mastitis. Later, the patient was treated with antituberculous drugs for 6 months, and the above symptoms subsided. Individuals with breast lesions who do not respond well to antibiotics should be suspected of having breast tuberculosis, especially if they are young and reside in or were born in a nation where the disease is prevalent.

    Title: Gastric Signet Ring Cell Carcinoma Metastasis From Lobular Breast Cancer: A Diagnostic Pitfall.
    Authors: Kartotaroeno J, Bastid C, Puppa G
    Abstract: Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women worldwide. Gastric metastasis from invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast is unusual. We report the case of a 66-year-old woman, under follow-up for an invasive classic lobular carcinoma of the left breast treated four years prior, who was admitted for upper abdominal discomfort and worsening constipation. Linitis plastica was suspected at gastroscopy. Histology of gastric biopsies showed a poorly cohesive carcinoma comprising signet ring cells, with no resemblance to the original breast cancer. An adequate immunochemistry panel, including estrogen receptor and GATA-3, eliminated primary gastric cancer and proved that the gastric lesion was a metastasis of the previously diagnosed invasive lobular breast cancer with additional signet ring cell differentiation, which is classified among its rare variants. This challenging case shows the importance of oncologic medical history and immunochemistry in differentiating between metastasis from invasive lobular breast carcinoma and primary gastric cancer. The distinction is necessary as the prognosis and approaches for treatment are different. When encountering a gastric signet ring cell carcinoma, one must keep in mind that it actually can be a metastasis from one of the several primary sites of origin.

    Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Despite extensive studies of the impact of COVID-19 on patients with cancer, there is a dearth of information from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Our study aimed to report pertinent MENA COVID-19 and Cancer Registry (MCCR) findings on patient management and outcomes. METHODS: MCCR was adapted from the American Society of Clinical Oncology COVID-19 Registry to collect data specifically from patients with cancer and SARS-CoV-2 infection from 12 centers in eight countries including Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Egypt, Algeria, United Arab Emirates, and Morocco. The Registry included data on patients and disease characteristics, treatment, and patient outcomes. Logistic regression was used to assess associations with mortality. RESULTS: Between November 29, 2020, and June 8, 2021, data were captured on 2008 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from the beginning of the pandemic. Median age was 56 years (16-98), 56.4% were females, and 26% were current or ex-smokers. Breast cancer (28.5%) was the leading diagnosis and 50.5% had metastatic disease. Delays of planned treatment (>14 days) occurred in 80.3% for surgery, 48.8% for radiation therapy, and 32.9% for systemic therapy. Significant reduction in the delays of all three treatment modalities occurred after June 1, 2020. All-cause mortality rates at 30 and 90 days were 17.1% and 23.4%, respectively. All-cause mortality rates at 30 days did not change significantly after June 1, 2020; however, 90-day mortality increased from 33.4% to 42.9% before and after that date (p = 0.015). Multivariable regression analysis showed the following predictors of higher 30- and 90-day mortality: age older than 70 years, having metastatic disease, disease progression, and being off chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Patients with cancer in the MENA region experienced similar risks and outcome of COVID-19 as reported in other populations. Although there were fewer treatment delays after June 1, 2020, 90-day mortality increased, which may be attributed to other risk factors such as disease progression or new patients who presented with more advanced disease.

    Title: Phase Ib/II Study of Lacnotuzumab in Combination with Spartalizumab in Patients with Advanced Malignancies.
    Authors: Ahmed J, Stephen B, Yang Y, Kwiatkowski E, Ejezie CL, Pant S
    Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Blocking the colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) signal on tumor-associated macrophages can lead to an upregulation of checkpoint molecules, such as programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), thus causing resistance to this blockade. Combining spartalizumab (PDR001), a high-affinity, ligand-blocking, humanized anti-PD-1 immunoglobulin G4 antibody, with lacnotuzumab (MCS110), a high-affinity, humanized monoclonal antibody directed against human CSF-1 can potentially overcome this resistance. METHODS: This was a multicenter, phase Ib/II trial using a combination of spartalizumab with lacnotuzumab in patients with advanced cancers, including anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment-resistant melanoma, and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment-naive triple-negative breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and endometrial cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02807844). The primary objective of dose escalation phase Ib was to assess safety, tolerability, and recommended phase II dose. The primary objective of the phase II expansion study was to assess the combination's antitumor activity, including objective response rate and clinical benefit rate. RESULTS: A total of eight patients (five in phase Ib and three in phase II) were evaluable for adverse events (AEs) at our study site. All eight patients experienced at least grade 1 AE. The most common treatment-related AEs were increased serum aspartate aminotransferase (38%), fatigue (38%), anemia (25%), increased alkaline phosphatase (25%), hyperbilirubinemia (25%), hypocalcemia (25%), and hypoalbuminemia (25%). Most of these AEs were grade 1 or 2. None of the patients experienced grade 4 AEs and no drug-related fatal AEs were reported among the eight patients treated in the study. One (13%) patient had stable disease (SD) (captured as unknown by the study sponsor because the evaluation criteria set per protocol was not met) and three (38%) patients had progressive disease. Four (50%) patients developed clinical disease progression based on investigator evaluation. One patient with pancreatic cancer achieved immune-related SD for 26 months while on the study treatments. CONCLUSION: The study completed phase Ib dose escalation and phase II. However, gating criteria for efficacy were not met for expansion beyond 80 patients in phase II and the sponsor did not continue development of the combination of spartalizumab and lacnotuzumab for oncology indications. The potential signal of activity in pancreatic cancer should be further explored.

    Title: A Subjective Assessment of Chemotherapy Drug-Induced Taste and Smell Alteration in Non-head and Neck Cancer Patients: A Questionnaire-Based Cross-Sectional Study.
    Authors: Yadav N, Mittal S, Reddy P, Parihar A, Agrawal S, Mandlik R, Sharma AD
    Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate alterations in taste and smell perceptions among non-head and neck cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, aiming to identify factors influencing these changes. METHODS: A cohort of 70 non-head and neck cancer patients undergoing one to four cycles or more than four cycles, over a six-month period, from oncology outpatient clinics was recruited. Participants completed structured taste and smell questionnaires with assistance from interviewers. Demographic data, recurrence history, chemotherapy cycles, drug regimens, and taste and smell perceptions were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square tests. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 46.5 years, with a predominance of females (81.4%) and breast cancer cases (42.9%). Taste changes were more prevalent (62.9%) than smell changes (32.9%) post chemotherapy, particularly among those on combination drug regimens. Salty taste alterations were the most common (30.0%), followed by sweet taste (22.9%) and sour/bitter tastes (14.3%). Moreover, 38.57% of patients reported experiencing dysgeusia, while 30% noted the occurrence of parosmia post chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy-induced alterations in taste and smell significantly impact the quality of life and nutritional status of cancer patients. Despite often being overlooked, these changes warrant increased attention in oncological practice to inform treatment decisions and enhance symptom management, particularly in palliative care settings. Further research is needed to explore the implications of chemosensory alterations on patient outcomes and treatment strategies.

    Title: Staging and Management of Cervical Cancer at the Colposcopy Clinic of Bangabandhu Sheikh Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Bangladesh.
    Authors: Nessa A, Islam T, Noor-E-Ferdousi NE, Sultana A, Khan KH, Rashid HU
    Abstract: Anjuman SultanaCervical cancer (CC) ranks as the second most common cancer among women in Bangladesh. Unfortunately, due to late-stage diagnosis and inadequate treatment facilities, the mortality rate remains high. The stage at which CC is diagnosed plays a crucial role in predicting a woman's survival. This study aimed to determine the staging patterns of CC at presentation in the colposcopy clinic of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) and the subsequent management provided to these women. This retrospective study was conducted at the BSMMU colposcopy clinic from January 2019 to June 2020. It included CC cases with known staging, spanning from January 2016 to June 2019. Data were collected from the colposcopy registry book, telephone interviews, and face-to-face discussions during follow-up appointments. The mean age of women diagnosed with CC was 48.59 years (+/-2 standard deviations). Among the 523 women studied, 107 (20.5%) were diagnosed at stage I, 124 (23.7%) at stage IIA, 240 (45.9%) at stage IIB, while the remaining 52 (9.90%) were diagnosed with Stage III and IV disease. Within the study population, 39 (7.5%) women underwent radical hysterectomy alone, 110 (21.00%) underwent radical hysterectomy followed by adjuvant therapy, and 184 (35.14%) received primary radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiation. A significant portion of CC cases presented at an early stage, underscoring the importance of an effective screening program to prevent advanced-stage disease and enhance early detection rates. Establishing a patient navigation system immediately after diagnosis is crucial to prevent the loss of follow-up and ensure timely treatment. It is imperative to enhance the healthcare system's capacity to ensure timely treatment for cancer patients.

    Title: COVID-19 Impact on Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancers at Regional Cancer Centre, Thiruvananthapuram-An Audit.
    Authors: Babu G, Rajeev KR, Mathew A, Arjunan A, Priya B, Bhargavan R, Augustine P, Cherian K, Joseph R, Radhakrishnan N, Mathew BS
    Abstract: Geethu Babu The coronavirus pandemic has created havoc in every aspect of life including cancer care and was declared a pandemic. This audit was conducted to study the impact of the pandemic on diagnosis and treatment of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients at a tertiary cancer center in South India. A total of 1,647 patients who registered at Regional Cancer Centre (RCC), Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India for breast cancer during the period April 1, 2020, to September 30, 2020 (COVID-19 period) as well as April 1, 2019, to September 30, 2019 (pre-COVID-19 period) were included in the study. Data regarding the geographic distribution, stage at presentation, time factors for reporting for care, diagnosis, and treatment, referral for care elsewhere were collected and analyzed. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. Means and ranges were calculated for continuous type variables, and numbers and percentages for categorical variables. To determine whether there were significant differences between the two groups, independent t -test was used for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical type of variables. A notable reduction (36%) in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients was seen in 2020 when compared with 2019. There was a significant difference in the geographic distribution of patients in both cohorts ( p  = 0.001) and a notable reduction in the number of patients reporting to RCC for treatment from the northern districts of Kerala (81%) and outside Kerala (89.5%). There was no significant difference in the time (in weeks) since symptom onset and reporting to hospital or the clinical stage at diagnosis between the groups. Also, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) did not seem to negatively impact time intervals between date of registration and pathological diagnosis or start of primary treatment. More patients received neoadjuvant systemic therapy during 2020 compared with 2019, and this difference was statistically significant ( p  = 0.004). There was no difference in the type of surgery (breast-conserving surgery vs. modified radical mastectomy). The results demonstrate that COVID-19 did not appear to negatively impact the diagnosis and treatment of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients. However, this is largely attributable to the significantly less number of patients who registered, for whom the departments were able to maintain timely cancer care despite the difficult pandemic times. Significantly more patients received neoadjuvant systemic therapy in 2020.

    Title: Effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on fear of cancer recurrence and its underlying neuromechanism.
    Authors: Xu W, Zhao N, Li W, Qiu L, Luo X, Lin Y, Wang W, Garg S, Sun H, Yang Y
    Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Many breast cancer patients suffer from fear of cancer recurrence (FCR). However, effective physical intervention for FCR has been scarce. Previous studies have confirmed that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can help improve patients' anxiety, depression, fear, and stress level. Therefore, this study aims to assess the efficacy of rTMS in the treatment of FCR in breast cancer patients and explore its underlying neural mechanism. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: and analysis: Fifty breast cancer patients with high FCR (FCR total score >27), and fifty age- and gender-matched patients with low FCR (FCR total score <7) will be recruited to participate in this study. Patients in the high FCR group will be randomly assigned to receive 4-week low-frequency rTMS targeting the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) + treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 25), or to receive sham stimulation + TAU (n = 25). Patients in the low FCR group will only receive TAU. All participants will take a baseline fMRI scan to examine the local activities and interactions of brain activity between the prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), amygdala and hippocampus. Fear of Cancer Recurrence Questionnaire (FCRQ7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9), Generalize Anxiety Disorder (GAD7), Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI7) will be used to measure an individual's FCR, depression, anxiety, pain, and insomnia symptoms at week 0 (baseline), week 4 (the end of intervention), week 5 (1 week post-treatment), week 8 (1 month post-treatment), and week 16 (3 months post-treatment). Participants in the high FCR group will receive a post-treatment fMRI scan within 24 h after intervention to explore the neural mechanisms of rTMS treatment. The primary outcome of the study, whether the rTMS intervention is sufficient in relieving FCR in breast cancer patients, is measured by FCRQ7. Additionally, task activation, local activity and functional connectivity of the DLPFC, amygdala and hippocampus will be compared, between high and low FCR group, and before and after treatment. DISCUSSION: Studies have shown that low-frequency rTMS can be used to treat patient's FCR. However, there is a lack of relevant evidence to support the efficacy of rTMS on FCR in cancer patients, and the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of rTMS on FCR need to be further investigated. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for the study has been obtained from the Ethics Committee of Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital (reference number: KY-N-2022-136-01). The results of the investigation will be published in scientific papers. The data from the investigation will be made available online if necessary. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT05881889 (ClinicalTrials.gov). Date of registration: May 31, 2023.

    Title: Biological effects of intraoperative radiation therapy: histopathological changes and immunomodulation in breast cancer patients.
    Authors: Orozco JIJ, Valdez BJ, Matsuba C, Simanonok MP, Ensenyat-Mendez M, Ramiscal JAB, Salomon MP, Takasumi Y, Grumley JG
    Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) delivers a single accelerated radiation dose to the breast tumor bed during breast-conserving surgery (BCS). The synergistic biologic effects of simultaneous surgery and radiation remain unclear. This study explores the cellular and molecular changes induced by IORT in the tumor microenvironment and its impact on the immune response modulation. METHODS: Patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive/HER2-negative, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or early-stage invasive breast carcinoma undergoing BCS with margin re-excision were included. Histopathological evaluation and RNA-sequencing in the re-excision tissue were compared between patients with IORT (n=11) vs. non-IORT (n=11). RESULTS: Squamous metaplasia with atypia was exclusively identified in IORT specimens (63.6%, p=0.004), mimicking DCIS. We then identified 1,662 differentially expressed genes (875 upregulated and 787 downregulated) between IORT and non-IORT samples. Gene ontology analyses showed that IORT was associated with the enrichment of several immune response pathways, such as inflammatory response, granulocyte activation, and T-cell activation (p<0.001). When only considering normal tissue from both cohorts, IORT was associated with intrinsic apoptotic signaling, response to gamma radiation, and positive regulation of programmed cell death (p<0.001). Using the xCell algorithm, we inferred a higher abundance of gammadelta T-cells, dendritic cells, and monocytes in the IORT samples. CONCLUSION: IORT induces histological changes, including squamous metaplasia with atypia, and elicits molecular alterations associated with immune response and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. The increased abundance of immune-related components in breast tissue exposed to IORT suggests a potential shift towards active immunogenicity, particularly immune-desert tumors like HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer.

    Title: Artificial intelligence-based classification of breast nodules: a quantitative morphological analysis of ultrasound images.
    Authors: Pan H, Shi C, Zhang Y, Zhong Z
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Accurate classification of breast nodules into benign and malignant types is critical for the successful treatment of breast cancer. Traditional methods rely on subjective interpretation, which can potentially lead to diagnostic errors. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods using the quantitative morphological analysis of ultrasound images have been explored for the automated and reliable classification of breast cancer. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of AI-based approaches for improving diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes. METHODS: In this study, a quantitative analysis approach was adopted, with a focus on five critical features for evaluation: degree of boundary regularity, clarity of boundaries, echo intensity, and uniformity of echoes. Furthermore, the classification results were assessed using five machine learning methods: logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes, and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). Based on these assessments, a multifeature combined prediction model was established. RESULTS: We evaluated the performance of our classification model by quantifying various features of the ultrasound images and using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). The moment of inertia achieved an AUC value of 0.793, while the variance and mean of breast nodule areas achieved AUC values of 0.725 and 0.772, respectively. The convexity and concavity achieved AUC values of 0.988 and 0.987, respectively. Additionally, we conducted a joint analysis of multiple features after normalization, achieving a recall value of 0.98, which surpasses most medical evaluation indexes on the market. To ensure experimental rigor, we conducted cross-validation experiments, which yielded no significant differences among the classifiers under 5-, 8-, and 10-fold cross-validation (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative analysis can accurately differentiate between benign and malignant breast nodules.

    Title: Optimal Glycated Hemoglobin Cutoff for Diagnosis of Diabetes and Prediabetes in Chinese Breast Cancer Women.
    Authors: Liang XY, Mu LY, Hu L, She RL, Ma CY, Feng JH, Jiang ZY, Li ZX, Qu XQ, Peng BQ, Wu KN, Kong LQ
    Abstract: PURPOSE: Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is widely used in diabetes management and now recommended for diagnosis and risk assessment. Our research focused on investigating the optimal cutoff points of HbA1c for diagnosis of diabetes and prediabetes in Chinese breast cancer women, aiming to enhance early detection and tailor treatment strategies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study involved 309 breast cancer women without diabetes history in China. Patients were categorized into groups of newly diagnosed diabetes, prediabetes, and normal glucose tolerance using oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) according to the 2010 ADA criteria. HbA1c data were collected from all patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess the effectiveness of the HbA1c screening. RESULTS: Among the 309 breast cancer women without diabetes history, 96 (31.0%) were identified with diabetes and 130 (42.1%) had prediabetes according to OGTT, and the incidence of normal glucose tolerance was only 26.9% (83). ROC curve analysis, using OGTT as a reference, revealed that the area under the curve of 0.903 (P<0.001, 95% CI, 0.867-0.938) for HbA1c alone, indicating high accuracy. The optimal HbA1c cutoff for identifying diabetes was determined to be 6.0%, with a sensitivity of 78.1% and specificity of 86.4%. For prediabetes, the ROC curve for HbA1c alone showed that the area under the ROC curve of 0.703 (P<0.001, 95% CI, 0.632-0.774), with an optimal cutoff of 5.5% (sensitivity of 76.9% and specificity of 51.8%). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes is very high in breast cancer women without diabetes history in China. The optimal cutoff points of HbA1c for identifying diabetes and prediabetes are 6.0% and 5.5% in Chinese breast cancer women, respectively.

    Title: Targeting ACAT1 in cancer: from threat to treatment.
    Authors: Sun T, Xiao X
    Abstract: Altered cholesterol metabolism has been identified as a critical feature of cancers. Cholesterol functions as the main component of cell membrane, cholesterol and is required for sustaining membrane integrity and mediating signaling transduction for cell survival. The intracellular level of cholesterol is dynamically regulated. Excessive cholesterol could be converted to less toxic cholesteryl esters by acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferases (ACATs). While ACAT2 has limited value in cancers, ACAT1 has been found to be widely participated in tumor initiation and progression. Moreover, due to the important role of cholesterol metabolism in immune function, ACAT1 is also essential for regulating anti-tumor immunity. ACAT1 inhibition may be exploited as a potential strategy to enhance the anti-tumor immunity and eliminate tumors. Herein, a comprehensive understanding of the role of ACAT1 in tumor development and anti-tumor immunity may provide new insights for anti-tumor strategies.

    Title: Breast cancer insights from Northern Israel: a comprehensive analysis of survival rates among Jewish and Arab women.
    Authors: Badran O, Campisi-Pinto S, Amna MA, Turgeman I, Yosef S, Bar-Sela G
    Abstract: This study investigates breast cancer survival rates between 2000 and 2022 in northern Israel, focusing on ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age at diagnosis, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Analyzing data from Clalit Health Services, we studied 8,431 breast cancer patients (6,395 Jewish, 2,036 Arab). We compared five- and ten-year survival rates across different demographics. Ethnicity showed a minor impact on survival (OR 1.12, 95% CI: 0.93 - 1.35). Socioeconomic status had a significant effect, with a higher level of improving survival (OR 2.50, 95% CI: 2.04 - 3.08). Age was crucial; women 18-39 had better survival than 60-100, but no significant difference was found between the 18-39 and 40-59 age groups [OR (CI 0.90 - 1.53, p = 0.231)]. For the Charlson Comorbidity Index, women with scores of 3-10 showed lower survival compared to scores of 0 and 1-2. There was a notable improvement in five-year survival rates among patients aged 18-59 diagnosed from 2009-2018 (90.7%) compared to 2000-2008 (86.9%) (p = 0.0046), but not in patients aged 60-100. The study highlights that socioeconomic status, age, and comorbidity scores are significant in determining survival rates for breast cancer. The improvement in survival rates for younger patients diagnosed more recently reflects advancements in treatment and care. This research provides valuable insights into the factors affecting breast cancer survival rates, underscoring the role of socioeconomic status, age, and comorbidities while also highlighting the progress in breast cancer treatment over recent years.

    Title: The expression and role of the Lem-D proteins Ankle2, Emerin, Lemd2, and TMPO in triple-negative breast cancer cell growth.
    Authors: Rose M, Burgess JT, Cheong CM, Adams MN, Shahrouzi P, O'Byrne KJ, Richard DJ, Bolderson E
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a sub-classification of breast carcinomas, which leads to poor survival outcomes for patients. TNBCs do not possess the hormone receptors that are frequently targeted as a therapeutic in other cancer subtypes and, therefore, chemotherapy remains the standard treatment for TNBC. Nuclear envelope proteins are frequently dysregulated in cancer cells, supporting their potential as novel cancer therapy targets. The Lem-domain (Lem-D) (LAP2, Emerin, MAN1 domain, and Lem-D) proteins are a family of inner nuclear membrane proteins, which share a ~45-residue Lem-D. The Lem-D proteins, including Ankle2, Lemd2, TMPO, and Emerin, have been shown to be associated with many of the hallmarks of cancer. This study aimed to define the association between the Lem-D proteins and TNBC and determine whether these proteins could be promising therapeutic targets. METHODS: GENT2, TCGA, and KM plotter were utilized to investigate the expression and prognostic implications of several Lem-D proteins: Ankle2, TMPO, Emerin, and Lemd2 in publicly available breast cancer patient data. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescent analysis of immortalized non-cancerous breast cells and a panel of TNBC cells were utilized to establish whether protein expression of the Lem-D proteins was significantly altered in TNBC. SiRNA was used to decrease individual Lem-D protein expression, and functional assays, including proliferation assays and apoptosis assays, were conducted. RESULTS: The Lem-D proteins were generally overexpressed in TNBC patient samples at the mRNA level and showed variable expression at the protein level in TNBC cell lysates. Similarly, protein levels were generally negatively correlated with patient survival outcomes. siRNA-mediated depletion of the individual Lem-D proteins in TNBC cells induced aberrant nuclear morphology, decreased proliferation, and induced cell death. However, minimal effects on nuclear morphology or cell viability were observed following Lem-D depletion in non-cancerous MCF10A cells. CONCLUSION: There is evidence to suggest that Ankle2, TMPO, Emerin, and Lemd2 expressions are correlated with breast cancer patient outcomes, but larger patient sample numbers are required to confirm this. siRNA-mediated depletion of these proteins was shown to specifically impair TNBC cell growth, suggesting that the Lem-D proteins may be a specific anti-cancer target.

    Title: Cordycepin enhances anti-tumor immunity in breast cancer by enhanceing ALB expression.
    Authors: Chen L, Wei W, Sun J, Sun B, Deng R
    Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The treatment of breast cancer still faces great challenges, and it is necessary to continuously explore effective drugs and targets to promote immune precision medicine. This study aims to investigate the immune-related regulatory mechanism of cordycepin in breast cancer. METHODS: Network pharmacology was employed to discovery the action of cordyceps on breast cancer targets, molecular docking was employed to analyze the interaction pattern between core components and targets, and biological information analysis was used to explore the target-related immune mechanism and verified in vitro experiments. RESULTS: The results of this study indicate that cordycepin can effectively inhibit breast cancer. The roles of cordycepin's active component and its target gene ALB were elucidated through the combined use of network pharmacology and molecular docking. Bioinformatics analysis revealed convincing associations between ALB and many immune pathway marker genes. ALB was inhibited in tumor expression, and cordycepin was found to enhance the expression of ALB in vitro to play an anti-tumor role. CONCLUSION: Cordycepin regulates immune suppression of tumor, which is expected to open a new chapter of breast cancer immunotherapy.

    Title: Pathology and resection margins following mastectomy prior to immediate breast reconstruction.
    Authors: Jorgensen AK, Bille C, Jylling AMB, Kaidar-Person O, Tramm T
    Abstract: Risk of local recurrence (LR) (and even distant disease-free survival) after mastectomy is associated with margin status. Furthermore, the vast majority of LR are located at the anterior (superficial) margin. Margins in mastectomy are considered anatomical borders and not true resection margins; such a conception may erroneously lead to underestimation of the risk of LR after mastectomy. If dissection is accurate along the fascia, only skin, subcutaneous tissue and minimal residual breast gland tissue (rBGT) are expected to remain in the patient. However, the subcutaneous fascia is an inconsistent anatomical structure that may be absent in almost half of patients. Studies and routine clinical practice suggest that resection may frequently, though often focally, be within the breast glandular tissue leaving various amounts of rBGT. Such areas may be nidus for subsequent de novo or recurrent premalignant or malignant disease. There is no consensus on handling of close/positive margins and intervention is extrapolated from studies on breast conserving surgery with subsequent radiotherapy. Handling of a close/positive margin is complicated by poor correlation between the ex vivo findings on the specimen and the attempt to relocate the area of concern in a patient with reconstructed breasts. In this clinical practice review, we strongly advocate for reporting of the lesion-to-margin distance in mastectomies to collect further evidence on the association between LR and margin status.

    Title: Sensate immediate breast reconstruction.
    Authors: Peled AW, Peled ZM
    Abstract: As breast cancer therapies and associated oncologic outcomes continue to improve, greater attention has been placed on quality-of-life issues after breast cancer and breast cancer risk-reducing treatments. The loss of sensation that typically occurs after mastectomy can have significant negative psychological, sexual, and functional impact on patients after surgery. Further, injury of nerves not only leads to numbness, but can also cause chronic neuropathic pain, which can be very debilitating to affected patients. In order to minimize these impacts, there is expanding uptake of surgical approaches that preserve nerves at the time of mastectomy and reconstruct injured nerves either during mastectomy or during delayed reconstruction. These advances have been facilitated by anatomic studies investigating different variants of intercostal anatomy and better understanding the course of the nerves innervating the mastectomy skin and nipple-areolar complex (NAC). With improved knowledge of the intercostal nerve anatomy, surgeons are able to carefully preserve nerves at the time of mastectomy, thus improving sensory outcomes. Additionally, nerve reconstruction techniques have advanced, particularly with newer nerve allograft technologies, which allows for nerve reconstruction to be done both at the time of mastectomy, as well as in a delayed fashion. The focus of this article is to describe the current state of sensory preservation and immediate reinnervation at the time of mastectomy and the advances that have allowed for these new approaches.

    Title: Novel role of LLGL2 silencing in autophagy: reversing epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.
    Authors: Hong GL, Kim KH, Kim YJ, Lee HJ, Cho SP, Han SY, Yang SW, Lee JS, Kang SK, Lim JS, Jung JY
    Abstract: PURPOSE: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a major urological disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in men. LLGL2 is the mammalian homolog of Lgl. It acts as a tumor suppressor in breast and hepatic cancer. However, the role of LLGL2 and the underlying mechanisms in PCa have not yet been elucidated. Here, we investigate the role of LLGL2 in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in PCa through autophagy in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: PC3 cells were transfected with siLLGL2 or plasmid LLGL2 and autophagy was examined. Invasion, migration, and wound healing were assessed in PC3 cells under autophagy regulation. Tumor growth was evaluated using a shLLGL2 xenograft mouse model. RESULTS: In patients with PCa, LLGL2 levels were higher with defective autophagy and increased EMT. Our results showed that the knockdown of LLGL2 induced autophagy flux by upregulating Vps34 and ATG14L. LLGL2 knockdown inhibits EMT by upregulating E-cadherin and downregulating fibronectin and alpha-SMA. The pharmacological activation of autophagy by rapamycin suppressed EMT, and these effects were reversed by 3-methyladenine treatment. Interestingly, in a shLLGL2 xenograft mouse model, tumor size and EMT were decreased, which were improved by autophagy induction and worsened by autophagy inhibition. CONCLUSION: Defective expression of LLGL2 leads to attenuation of EMT due to the upregulation of autophagy flux in PCa. Our results suggest that LLGL2 is a novel target for alleviating PCa via the regulation of autophagy.

    Title: Factors influencing presentation delay among cancer patients: a cross-sectional study in Malaysia.
    Authors: Gyeltshen T, Teh HS, Loo CE, Hing NYL, Lim WY, Subramaniam S, Wong WJ, Wong ZS, Hwong WY
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cancer represents a significant global public health challenge, with escalating incidence rates straining healthcare systems. Malaysia, like many nations, has witnessed a rise in cancer cases, particularly among the younger population. This study aligns with Malaysia's National Strategic Plan for Cancer Control Programme 2021-2025, emphasizing primary prevention and early detection to address cancer's impact. Therefore, we aim to describe the timeliness of cancer care for symptom presentation, socio-demographic, patient, as well as organizational-related factors among patients in Malaysia diagnosed with breast, colorectal, nasopharyngeal, and cervical cancer. METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled adult cancer patients diagnosed with breast, cervical, colorectal, or nasopharyngeal cancer from 2015 to 2020 in seven public hospitals/oncology centres across Malaysia. Data were collected through patient-administered surveys and medical records. Presentation delay, defined as the duration between symptom onset and the patient's first visit to a healthcare professional exceeding 30 days, was the primary outcome. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics and chi-square tests. RESULTS: The study included 476 cancer patients, with breast cancer (41.6%), colorectal cancer (26.9%), nasopharyngeal cancer (22.1%), and cervical cancer (9.5%). Over half (54.2%) experienced presentation delays with a median interval of 60 days. Higher proportions of presentation delay were observed among nasopharyngeal cancer patients, employed patients with lower socioeconomic statuses, and those without family history of cancer. Most patients self-discovered their first cancer symptoms (80%), while only one-third took immediate action for medical check-ups. Emotional and organizational factors, such as long waiting times during doctor's visits (47%), were potential barriers to seeking cancer care. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the significant problem of presentation delay among cancer patients in Malaysia. The delay is influenced by various factors encompassing sociodemographic characteristics, health-seeking behaviours, and healthcare system-related issues. A comprehensive approach addressing both individual barriers and institutional obstacles is imperative to mitigate this presentation delay and improve cancer outcomes.

    Title: Outcome and Factors Related to Isolated Liver Metastasis due to Breast Cancer.
    Authors: Sen E, Canbak T, Bostanci O, Battal M
    Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine the associated risk factors for isolated liver metastasis in breast cancer patients and to detect the prognostic factors related to survival. STUDY DESIGN: Analytical study. Place and Duration of the Study: Department of General Surgery, The University of Health Sciences, Istanbul, Turkiye, from January 2011 to November 2020. METHODOLOGY: Patients with breast cancer liver metastasis who experienced surgery were retrospectively analysed for breast cancer and metastases-related characteristics. Descriptive statistical methods were used in the evaluation of data. Survival analyses were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank and univariable Cox regression tests were utilised to search for prognostic factors' impact on survival. RESULTS: Out of 12 patients, 11 had recurrent disease after a median of 36 months of disease-free survival (DFS) and one patient had de novo metastasis. Grade 3 tumours and increased expression of Ki-67 had a negative effect on DFS. The median follow-up period was 66 months. Survival analysis showed 2- and 3-year progression-free survival (PFS); overall survival rates were 82%, 69%, 92%, and 82%, respectively. Development of liver metastasis in 3 years following breast cancer treatment was linked to worse PFS (p = 0.040). CONCLUSION:  Long-term survival is possible for breast cancer survivors with liver metastasis. Disease-free interval is an important determinant. Longer progression-free survival was detected in patients who had developed metastasis after three years of breast cancer treatment. KEY WORDS: Breast cancer, Liver metastasis, Hepatic surgery.

    Title: SNHG15-mediated feedback loop interplays with HNRNPA1/SLC7A11/GPX4 pathway to promote gastric cancer progression.
    Authors: Duan Y, Yan Y, Fu H, Dong Y, Li K, Ye Z, Dou Y, Huang B, Kang W, Wei GH, Cai Q, Xu D, Zhou D
    Abstract: Dysregulation of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) expression plays a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of gastric cancer (GC). However, the regulation of lncRNA SNHG15 in GC has not been well studied. Mechanisms for ferroptosis by SNHG15 have not been revealed. Here, we aimed to explore SNHG15-mediated biological functions and underlying molecular mechanisms in GC. The novel SNHG15 was identified by analyzing RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data of GC tissues from our cohort and TCGA dataset, and further validated by qRT-PCR in GC cells and tissues. Gain- and loss-of-function assays were performed to examine the role of SNHG15 on GC both in vitro and in vivo. SNHG15 was highly expressed in GC. The enhanced SNHG15 was positively correlated with malignant stage and poor prognosis in GC patients. Gain- and loss-of-function studies showed that SNHG15 was required to affect GC cell growth, migration and invasion both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the oncogenic transcription factors E2F1 and MYC could bind to the SNHG15 promoter and enhance its expression. Meanwhile, SNHG15 increased E2F1 and MYC mRNA expression by sponging miR-24-3p. Notably, SNHG15 could also enhance the stability of SLC7A11 in the cytoplasm by competitively binding HNRNPA1. In addition, SNHG15 inhibited ferroptosis through an HNRNPA1-dependent regulation of SLC7A11/GPX4 axis. Our results support a novel model in which E2F1- and MYC-activated SNHG15 regulates ferroptosis via an HNRNPA1-dependent modulation of the SLC7A11/GPX4 axis, which serves as the critical effectors in GC progression, and provides a new therapeutic direction in the treatment of GC.

    Title: Vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 knockdown exerts anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, anti-autophagic, and pro-ferroptotic effects on colorectal cancer cells by inhibition of the JAK/STAT3 pathway.
    Authors: Xu Y, Yang T, Xu Q, Tang Y, Yang Q
    Abstract: Vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 (VAMP8), a soluble n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor receptor protein, acts as an oncogenic gene in the progression of several malignancies. Nevertheless, the roles and mechanisms of VAMP8 in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression remain unknown. The expression and prognostic significance of VAMP8 in CRC samples were analyzed through bioinformatics analyses. Cell proliferation was detected using CCK-8 and EdU incorporation assays and apoptosis was evaluated via flow cytometry. Western blot analysis was conducted to examine the protein expression. Ferroptosis was evaluated by measurement of iron metabolism, lipid peroxidation, and glutathione (GSH) content. VAMP8 was increased in CRC samples relative to normal samples on the basis of GEPIA and HPA databases. CRC patients with high level of VAMP8 had a worse overall survival. VAMP8 depletion led to a suppression of proliferation and promotion of apoptosis in CRC cells. Additionally, VAMP8 knockdown suppressed beclin1 expression and LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, elevated p62 expression, increased Fe(2+), labile iron pool, lipid reactive oxygen species, and malondialdehyde levels, and repressed GSH content and glutathione peroxidase activity. Moreover, VAMP8 knockdown inhibited the activation of janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway in CRC cells. Mechanistically, activation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway by JAK1 or JAK2 overexpression attenuated VAMP8 silencing-mediated anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, anti-autophagic, and pro-ferroptotic effects on CRC cells. In conclusion, VAMP8 knockdown affects the proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, and ferroptosis by the JAK/STAT3 pathway in CRC cells.

    Title: Effects of a combined exercise and dietary intervention on body composition, physical functioning and fatigue in patients with ovarian cancer: results of the PADOVA trial.
    Authors: Kenkhuis MF, Stelten S, Hartman YA, Brouwer CG, Ten Tusscher MR, van Lonkhuijzen LR, Kenter GG, van Driel WJ, Winkels RM, Bekkers RL, Ottevanger NP, Hoedjes M, Buffart LM
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend to include exercise and dietary advice in standard care for patients with cancer, based on evidence primarily derived from patients with breast cancer. Its applicability to patients with ovarian cancer is uncertain due to differences in patient characteristics and treatments. The PADOVA trial examined the effectiveness of a combined exercise and dietary intervention on fat-free mass (FFM), physical functioning, and fatigue. METHODS: In total, 81 patients with ovarian cancer were randomised to the exercise and dietary intervention (n = 40) or control (n = 41) group. Measurements were performed before chemotherapy, after chemotherapy, and 12 weeks later. FFM was assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis, and physical functioning and fatigue were assessed using questionnaires. Intervention effects were assessed on an intention-to-treat basis using linear mixed models. RESULTS: FFM and physical functioning increased, and fatigue decreased significantly over time in both groups. No significant difference between the groups were found for FFM (beta = -0.5 kg; 95% CI = -3.2; 2.1), physical functioning (beta = 1.4; 95% CI = -5.4; 8.3) and fatigue (beta = 0.7; 95% CI = -1.5; 2.8). CONCLUSIONS: During treatment, both groups improved in FFM, physical functioning, and fatigue. The intervention group, however, did not demonstrate additional benefits compared to the control group. This highlights the need for caution when extrapolating findings from different cancer populations to patients with ovarian cancer.

    Title: A prismatic view of the epigenetic-metabolic regulatory axis in breast cancer therapy resistance.
    Authors: Das C, Bhattacharya A, Adhikari S, Mondal A, Mondal P, Adhikary S, Roy S, Ramos K, Yadav KK, Tainer JA, Pandita TK
    Abstract: Epigenetic regulation established during development to maintain patterns of transcriptional expression and silencing for metabolism and other fundamental cell processes can be reprogrammed in cancer, providing a molecular mechanism for persistent alterations in phenotype. Metabolic deregulation and reprogramming are thus an emerging hallmark of cancer with opportunities for molecular classification as a critical preliminary step for precision therapeutic intervention. Yet, acquisition of therapy resistance against most conventional treatment regimens coupled with tumor relapse, continue to pose unsolved problems for precision healthcare, as exemplified in breast cancer where existing data informs both cancer genotype and phenotype. Furthermore, epigenetic reprograming of the metabolic milieu of cancer cells is among the most crucial determinants of therapeutic resistance and cancer relapse. Importantly, subtype-specific epigenetic-metabolic interplay profoundly affects malignant transformation, resistance to chemotherapy, and response to targeted therapies. In this review, we therefore prismatically dissect interconnected epigenetic and metabolic regulatory pathways and then integrate them into an observable cancer metabolism-therapy-resistance axis that may inform clinical intervention. Optimally coupling genome-wide analysis with an understanding of metabolic elements, epigenetic reprogramming, and their integration by metabolic profiling may decode missing molecular mechanisms at the level of individual tumors. The proposed approach of linking metabolic biochemistry back to genotype, epigenetics, and phenotype for specific tumors and their microenvironment may thus enable successful mechanistic targeting of epigenetic modifiers and oncometabolites despite tumor metabolic heterogeneity.

    Title: Targeting EMT using low-dose Teniposide by downregulating ZEB2-driven activation of RNA polymerase I in breast cancer.
    Authors: Metge BJ, Alsheikh HAM, Kammerud SC, Chen D, Das D, Nebane NM, Bostwick JR, Shevde LA, Samant RS
    Abstract: Metastatic dissemination from the primary tumor is a complex process that requires crosstalk between tumor cells and the surrounding milieu and involves the interplay between numerous cellular-signaling programs. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) remains at the forefront of orchestrating a shift in numerous cellular programs, such as stemness, drug resistance, and apoptosis that allow for successful metastasis. Till date, there is limited success in therapeutically targeting EMT. Utilizing a high throughput screen of FDA-approved compounds, we uncovered a novel role of the topoisomerase inhibitor, Teniposide, in reversing EMT. Here, we demonstrate Teniposide as a potent modulator of the EMT program, specifically through an IRF7-NMI mediated response. Furthermore, Teniposide significantly reduces the expression of the key EMT transcriptional regulator, Zinc Finger E-Box Binding Homeobox 2 (ZEB2). ZEB2 downregulation by Teniposide inhibited RNA polymerase I (Pol I) activity and rRNA biogenesis. Importantly, Teniposide treatment markedly reduced pulmonary colonization of breast cancer cells. We have uncovered a novel role of Teniposide, which when used at a very low concentration, mitigates mesenchymal-like invasive phenotype. Overall, its ability to target EMT and rRNA biogenesis makes Teniposide a viable candidate to be repurposed as a therapeutic option to restrict breast cancer metastases.

    Title: Validation of prostate and breast cancer detection artificial intelligence algorithms for accurate histopathological diagnosis and grading: a retrospective study with a Japanese cohort.
    Authors: Lami K, Yoon HS, Parwani AV, Pham HHN, Tachibana Y, Linhart C, Grinwald M, Vecsler M, Fukuoka J
    Abstract: Prostate and breast cancer incidence rates have been on the rise in Japan, emphasising the need for precise histopathological diagnosis to determine patient prognosis and guide treatment decisions. However, existing diagnostic methods face numerous challenges and are susceptible to inconsistencies between observers. To tackle these issues, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have been developed to aid in the diagnosis of prostate and breast cancer. This study focuses on validating the performance of two such algorithms, Galen Prostate and Galen Breast, in a Japanese cohort, with a particular focus on the grading accuracy and the ability to differentiate between invasive and non-invasive tumours. The research entailed a retrospective examination of 100 consecutive prostate and 100 consecutive breast biopsy cases obtained from a Japanese institution. Our findings demonstrated that the AI algorithms showed accurate cancer detection, with AUCs of 0.969 and 0.997 for the Galen Prostate and Galen Breast, respectively. The Galen Prostate was able to detect a higher Gleason score in four adenocarcinoma cases and detect a previously unreported cancer. The two algorithms successfully identified relevant pathological features, such as perineural invasions and lymphovascular invasions. Although further improvements are required to accurately differentiate rare cancer subtypes, these findings highlight the potential of these algorithms to enhance the precision and efficiency of prostate and breast cancer diagnosis in Japan. Furthermore, this validation paves the way for broader adoption of these algorithms as decision support tools within the Asian population.

    Title: Microalgae-made human vaccines and therapeutics: A decade of advances.
    Authors: Trujillo E, Monreal-Escalante E, Angulo C
    Abstract: Microalgal emergence is a promising platform with two-decade historical background for producing vaccines and biopharmaceuticals. During that period, microalgal-based vaccines have reported successful production for various diseases. Thus, species selection is important for genetic transformation and delivery methods that have been developed. Although many vaccine prototypes have been produced for infectious and non-infectious diseases, fewer studies have reached immunological and immunoprotective evaluations. Microalgae-made vaccines for Staphylococcus aureus, malaria, influenza, human papilloma, and Zika viruses have been explored in their capacity to induce humoral or cellular immune responses and protective efficacies against experimental challenges. Therefore, specific pathogen antigens and immune system role are important and addressed in controlling these infections. Regarding non-communicable diseases, these vaccines have been investigated for breast cancer; microalgal-produced therapeutic molecules and microalgal-made interferon-alpha have been explored for hypertension and potential applications in treating viral infections and cancer, respectively. Thus, conducting immunological trials is emphasized, discussing the promising results observed in terms of immunogenicity, desired immune response for controlling affections, and challenges for achieving the desired protection levels. The potential advantages and hurdles associated with this innovative approach are highlighted, underlining the relevance of assessing immune responses in preclinical and clinical trials to validate the efficacy of these biopharmaceuticals. The promising future of this healthcare technology is also envisaged.

    Title: Preliminary efficacy and safety of YSCH-01 in patients with advanced solid tumors: an investigator-initiated trial.
    Authors: He Y, Huang X, Li X, Liu H, Liu M, Tao J, Shan Y, Raza HK, Liu Y, Zhong W, Cao XP, Yang YY, Li R, Fang XL, Zhang KJ, Zhang R, Liu F
    Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of YSCH-01 (Recombinant L-IFN adenovirus) in subjects with advanced solid tumors. METHODS: In this single-center, open-label, investigator-initiated trial of YSCH-01, 14 patients with advanced solid tumors were enrolled. The study consisted of two distinct phases: (1) the dose escalation phase and (2) the dose expansion phase; with three dose groups in the dose escalation phase based on dose levels (5.0x10(9) viral particles (VP)/subject, 5.0x10(10) VP/subject, and 5.0x10(11) VP/subject). Subjects were administered YSCH-01 injection via intratumoral injections. The safety was assessed using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V.5.0, and the efficacy evaluation was performed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor V.1.1. RESULTS: 14 subjects were enrolled in the study, including 9 subjects in the dose escalation phase and 5 subjects in the dose expansion phase. Of the 13 subjects included in the full analysis set, 4 (30.8%) were men and 9 (69.2%) were women. The most common tumor type was lung cancer (38.5%, 5 subjects), followed by breast cancer (23.1%, 3 subjects) and melanoma (23.1%, 3 subjects). During the dose escalation phase, no subject experienced dose-limiting toxicities. The content of recombinant L-IFN adenovirus genome and recombinant L-IFN protein in blood showed no trend of significant intergroup changes. No significant change was observed in interleukin-6 and interferon-gamma. For 11 subjects evaluated for efficacy, the overall response rate with its 95% CI was 27.3% (6.02% to 60.97%) and the disease control rate with its 95% CI was 81.8% (48.22% to 97.72%). The median progression-free survival was 4.97 months, and the median overall survival was 8.62 months. In addition, a tendency of decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions was observed. For 13 subjects evaluated for safety, the overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) was 92.3%, the overall incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) was 84.6%, and the overall incidence of >Grade 3 AEs was 7.7%, while no AEs/ADRs leading to death occurred. The most common AEs were fever (69.2%), nausea (30.8%), vomiting (30.8%), and hypophagia (23.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that YSCH-01 injections were safe and well tolerated and exhibited preliminary efficacy in patients with advanced solid tumors, supporting further investigation to evaluate its efficacy and safety.

    Title: Protease-activated receptor 2: a promising therapeutic target for women's cancers.
    Authors: Shah H, Fairlie DP, Lim J
    Abstract: Cancers affecting women, such as breast, uterine, ovarian, endometrial and cervical cancers, have become increasingly prevalent. The growing incidence and death rates associated with these cancers warrant the development of innovative and alternative approaches to current treatments. This article investigates the association of women's cancers with a molecular target known as protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2), a G-protein coupled receptor that is expressed on the surface of cancer cells. Expression levels of the PAR2 gene were curated from publicly available databases and were found to be significantly overexpressed in tissues from patients with breast, uterine, ovarian, endometrial or cervical cancer compared to normal tissues. PAR2 overexpression has been previously linked to tumor progression and, in some cases, tumor growth. Activation of PAR2 by either endogenous proteases or synthetic agonists triggers certain downstream intracellular signaling pathways that have been associated with tumor progression, cell migration and invasion, angiogenesis and apoptosis of cancer cells. While recent advances have led to the identification of several PAR2 antagonists, none has yet been developed for human use. Additionally, PAR2 inhibition has been shown also to increase the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs, allowing them to be potentially used at less toxic doses in combination therapies for cancer. The present work briefly summarizes the current status of PAR2 as a potential therapeutic target for treating women's cancers. Significance Statement This article highlights potential roles for PAR2 in cancers affecting women. Overexpression of the PAR2 gene in women's cancers is associated with various oncogenic processes such as tumor progression, cell migration and invasion, ultimately contributing to poorer patient prognoses. Given the increasing incidence of women's cancers, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutic drugs and PAR2 represents a promising target for developing new treatments.

    Title: Epigenetic Modulations in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: Therapeutic Implications for Tumor Microenvironment.
    Authors: Zhou L, Yu CW
    Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype lacking estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors and lacks HER2 overexpression. This absence of critical molecular targets poses significant challenges for conventional therapies. Immunotherapy, remarkably immune checkpoint blockade, offers promise for TNBC treatment, but its efficacy remains limited. Epigenetic dysregulation, including altered DNA methylation, histone modifications, and imbalances in regulators such as BET proteins, plays a crucial role in TNBC development and resistance to treatment. Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor gene promoters and the imbalance of histone methyltransferases such as EZH2 and histone deacetylases (HDACs) profoundly influence tumor cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis. In addition, epigenetic alterations critically shape the tumor microenvironment (TME), including immune cell composition, cytokine signaling, and immune checkpoint expression, ultimately contributing to immune evasion. Targeting these epigenetic mechanisms with specific inhibitors such as EZH2 and HDAC inhibitors in combination with immunotherapy represents a compelling strategy to remodel the TME, potentially overcoming immune evasion and enhancing therapeutic outcomes in TNBC. This review aims to comprehensively elucidate the current understanding of epigenetic modulation in TNBC, its influence on the TME, and the potential of combining epigenetic therapies with immunotherapy to overcome the challenges posed by this aggressive breast cancer subtype.

    Title: Cryoprotective isoliquiritigenin-zein phosphatidylcholine nanoparticles inhibits breast cancer-bone metastasis by targeting JAK-STAT signaling pathways.
    Authors: Ganesan K, Xu C, Xie C, Sui Y, Zheng C, Gao F, Chen J
    Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women and is known for its tendency to spread to the bones, causing significant health issues and mortality. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether cryoprotective isoliquiritigenin-zein phosphatidylcholine nanoparticles (ISL@ZLH NPs) could inhibit BC-induced bone destruction and tumor metastasis in both in vitro and animal models. To evaluate the potential of ISL@ZLH NPs, we conducted various experiments. First, we assessed cell viability, colony formation, transwell migration, and wound healing assays to determine the impact of ISL@ZLH NPs on BC cell behavior. Western blotting, TRAP staining and ALP activity were performed to examine the effects of ISL@ZLH NPs on osteoclast formation induced by MDA-MB-231 cell-conditioned medium and RANKL treated RAW 264.7 cells. Furthermore, we assessed the therapeutic impact of ISL@ZLH NPs on tumor-induced bone destruction using a mouse model of BC bone metastasis. Treatment with ISL@ZLH NPs effectively suppressed BC cell proliferation, colony formation, and motility, reducing their ability to metastasize. ISL@ZLH NPs significantly inhibited osteoclast formation and the expression of factors associated with bone destruction in BC cells. Additionally, ISL@ZLH NPs suppressed JAK-STAT signaling in RAW264.7 cells. In the BCBM mouse model, ISL@ZLH NPs led to a significant reduction in osteolytic bone lesions compared to the control group. Histological analysis and TRAP staining confirmed that ISL@ZLH NPs preserved the integrity of bone structure, preventing invasive metastasis by confining tumor growth to the bone marrow cavity. Furthermore, ISL@ZLH NPs effectively suppressed tumor-induced osteoclastogenesis, a key process in BC-related bone destruction. Our findings demonstrate that ISL@ZLH NPs have the potential to inhibit BC-induced bone destruction and tumor metastasis by targeting JAK-STAT signaling pathways and suppressing tumor-induced osteoclastogenesis. These results underscore the therapeutic promise of ISL@ZLH NPs in managing BC metastasis to the bones.

    Title: Association between endocrine adjuvant therapy intake timing and disease-free survival in patients with high-risk early breast cancer: results of a sub-study of the UCBG- UNIRAD trial.
    Authors: Giacchetti S, Laas E, Bachelot T, Lemonnier J, Andre F, Cameron D, Bliss J, Chabaud S, Hardy-Bessard AC, Lacroix-Triki M, Canon JL, Debled M, Campone M, Cottu P, Dalenc F, Ballesta A, Penault-Llorca F, Asselain B, Dumas E, Reyal F, Gougis P, Levi F, Hamy AS
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Circadian rhythms regulate cellular physiology and could influence the efficacy of endocrine therapy (ET) in breast cancer (BC). We prospectively tested this hypothesis within the UNIRAD adjuvant phase III trial (NCT01805271). METHODS: 1278 patients with high-risk hormonal receptor positive (HR+)/HER2 negative (HER2-) primary BC were randomly assigned to adjuvant ET with placebo or everolimus. Patients prospectively reported in a diary the daily timing of ET intake among four 6-h slots (06:00-11:59 (morning), 12:00-17:59 (afternoon), 18:00-23:59 (evening), or 24:00-05:59 (nighttime). The association between ET timing and disease-free survival (DFS) was a prespecified secondary endpoint of the trial and the results of this observational study are reported here. FINDINGS: ET timing was recorded by 855 patients (67.2%). Patients declaring morning (n = 465, 54.4%) or afternoon (n = 45, 5.4%) ET intake were older than those declaring evening (n = 339, 39.6%) or nighttime (n = 5, 0.6%) intake. With a median follow-up of 46.7 months, 118 patients had a local (n = 30) or metastasis relapse (n = 84), and 41 patients died. ET intake timing was not associated with DFS in the whole population (HR = 0.77, 95% CI [0.53-1.12]). The association between ET intake timing and DFS according to the stratification factors revealed interactions with ET agent (tamoxifen versus Aromatase inhibitors (AI) with an increased DFS in the group of evening/nighttime versus morning/afternoon tamoxifen intake (HR = 0.43, 95% CI [0.22-0.85]), while no association was found for AI intake (HR = 1.07, 95% CI [0.68-1.69]). The interaction between ET intake timing and ET agent remained in multivariable analysis (HR = 0.38 [0.16-0.91]). INTERPRETATION: Tamoxifen intake in the evening/nighttime could be recommended in patients with high-risk HR+/HER2- BC while awaiting for results from further ET timing studies. FUNDING: UNIRAD was Supported by a grant from the French Ministry of Health PHRC 2012 and received funding from La Ligue contre le Cancer, Cancer Research-UK, Myriad Genetics, and Novartis.

    Title: Magnesium whitlockite nanoparticles: Hydrothermal synthesis, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer potential.
    Authors: Maximiano LV, Correa LB, Gomes-da-Silva NC, da Costa LS, Da Silva MGP, Chaves AV, Franco ML, Fechine PBA, de Menezes AS, Santos-Oliveira R, Andrade Neto DM
    Abstract: This study revealed the potential of magnesium whitlockite [WH: Ca(18)Mg(2)(HPO(4))(2)(PO(4))(12)] nanoparticles (WH NPs) for anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer therapies. Although magnesium whitlockite possesses promising biological properties, its effects on inflammation and cancer remain unexplored. In this study, we address this gap by synthesizing WH NPs and demonstrating their multifaceted functionalities. Through detailed characterization, we revealed the synthesis pathway involving brushite as a precursor, with magnesium ions incorporated during hydrothermal treatment. WH NPs exhibited anti-inflammatory properties by significantly reducing the production of key inflammatory markers (NO, TNF-alpha, and IL-6). Furthermore, they display promising anti-cancer activity by inhibiting the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Our findings not only establish a deeper understanding of WH NP synthesis but also highlight their potential for the development of innovative cancer and inflammatory treatments.

    Title: Application of Patient-Reported Outcome Measurements in Adult Tumor Clinical Trials in China: Cross-Sectional Study.
    Authors: Jia Y, Li Q, Zhang X, Yan Y, Yan S, Li S, Li W, Wu X, Rong H, Liu J
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: International health policies and researchers have emphasized the value of evaluating patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in clinical studies. However, the characteristics of PROs in adult tumor clinical trials in China remain insufficiently elucidated. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the application and characteristics of PRO instruments as primary or secondary outcomes in adult randomized clinical trials related to tumors in China. METHODS: This cross-sectional study identified tumor-focused randomized clinical trials conducted in China between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2022. The ClinicalTrials.gov database and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry were selected as the databases. Trials were classified into four groups based on the use of PRO instruments: (1) trials listing PRO instruments as primary outcomes, (2) trials listing PRO instruments as secondary outcomes, (3) trials listing PRO instruments as coprimary outcomes, and (4) trials without any mention of PRO instruments. Pertinent data, including study phase, settings, geographic regions, centers, participant demographics (age and sex), funding sources, intervention types, target diseases, and the names of PRO instruments, were extracted from these trials. The target diseases involved in the trials were grouped according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual, 8th Edition. RESULTS: Among the 6445 trials examined, 2390 (37.08%) incorporated PRO instruments as part of their outcomes. Within this subset, 26.82% (641/2390) listed PRO instruments as primary outcomes, 52.72% (1260/2390) as secondary outcomes, and 20.46% (489/2390) as coprimary outcomes. Among the 2,155,306 participants included in these trials, PRO instruments were used to collect data from 613,648 (28.47%) patients as primary or secondary outcomes and from 74,287 (3.45%) patients as coprimary outcomes. The most common conditions explicitly using specified PRO instruments included thorax tumors (217/1280, 16.95%), breast tumors (176/1280, 13.75%), and lower gastrointestinal tract tumors (173/1280, 13.52%). Frequently used PRO instruments included the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire-30, the visual analog scale, the numeric rating scale, the Traditional Chinese Medicine Symptom Scale, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. CONCLUSIONS: Over recent years, the incorporation of PROs has demonstrated an upward trajectory in adult randomized clinical trials on tumors in China. Nonetheless, the infrequent measurement of the patient's voice remains noteworthy. Disease-specific PRO instruments should be more effectively incorporated into various tumor disease categories in clinical trials, and there is room for improvement in the inclusion of PRO instruments as clinical trial end points.

    Title: Elderly patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer with liver metastases benefit from low dose disitamab vedotin (RC48): case series and literature review.
    Authors: Qu FJ, Kong Y, Yan X, Wang H
    Abstract: Currently, although some antibody-drug conjugates have been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of drug-resistant relapsed human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/fluorescence in situ hybridization+) breast cancer, they are already approved for clinical use in China. But the clinical needs of advanced HER2-positive patients cannot be met due to adverse reactions, drug resistance, drug accessibility and other problems, thus affecting the prognosis of patients. In particular, the representation of elderly and frail patients in randomized clinical trials is significantly under-represented. We report on two elderly women with breast cancer who developed recurrent metastatic lesions after breast cancer surgery and were again confirmed HER2-positive by histopathology and immunohistochemistry. They all developed multiple metastases in the liver after second- or third-line anti-HER2 therapy. Subsequent treatment with RC48 produced good responses and tolerable adverse reactions. One patient obtained progression-free survival for more than 7 months. Based on preliminary evidence, this study shows that RC48 in HER2-positive breast cancer with liver metastases can achieve rapid remission, thereby reducing tumor load and improving patients' quality of life. In particular, RC48 has low side effects and can be well tolerated by elderly patients after dose adjustment, providing them with treatment opportunities. It needs to be further discussed in the future research.

    Title: Long-term cardiovascular disease risk after anthracycline and trastuzumab treatments in U.S. breast cancer survivors.
    Authors: Vo JB, Ramin C, Veiga LHS, Brandt C, Curtis RE, Bodelon C, Barac A, Roger VL, Feigelson HS, Buist DSM, Bowles EJA, Gierach GL, Berrington de Gonzalez A
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although breast cancer survivors are at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) from treatment late effects, evidence to inform long-term and age-specific cardiovascular surveillance recommendations is lacking. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 10,211 women diagnosed with first primary unilateral breast cancer in Kaiser Permanente Washington or Colorado (aged 20+, survived >/=1 year). We estimated multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) for associations between initial chemotherapy regimen type (anthracycline and/or trastuzumab, other chemotherapies, no chemotherapy [reference]) and CVD risk, adjusted for patient characteristics, other treatments, and CVD risk factors. Cumulative incidence was calculated considering competing events. RESULTS: After 5.79 median years, 14.67% of women developed CVD (cardiomyopathy/heart failure (CM/HF), ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke). Women treated with anthracyclines and/or trastuzumab had a higher risk of CVD compared with no chemotherapy (aHR=1.53,95%CI=1.31-1.79), persisting 5+years post-diagnosis (aHR5-<10 years=1.85,95%CI=1.44-2.39;aHR10+ years=1.83,95%CI=1.34-2.49). CM/HF risks were elevated among women treated with anthracyclines and/or trastuzumab compared with no chemotherapy, especially for ages<65 (aHR20-54years=2.97,95%CI=1.72-5.12;aHR55-64years=2.21,95%CI=1.52-3.21), differing for older women (aHR65+years=1.32,95%CI=0.97-1.78), and 5+years post-diagnosis (aHR5-<10years=1.89,95%CI=1.35-2.64;aHR10+years=2.21,95%CI=1.52-3.20). Anthracyclines and/or trastuzumab receipt was associated with increased IHD risks after 5+years (aHR5-<10years=1.51,95%CI=1.06-2.14;aHR10+years=1.86,95%CI=1.18-2.93) with no clear age effects, and stroke risk (aHR=1.33,95%CI=1.05-1.69) which did not vary by time or age. There was some evidence of long-term CM/HF and IHD risks with other chemotherapies. Among women aged<65 treated with anthracyclines and/or trastuzumab, up to 16% developed CVD by 10-years (20-54=6.91%;55-64=16.00%), driven by CM/HF (20-54=3.90%;55-64=9.78%). CONCLUSIONS: We found increased long-term risks of CM/HF and IHD among breast cancer survivors treated with anthracyclines and/or trastuzumab, and increased CM/HF risk among women aged<65.

    Title: Association between diabetes and subsequent malignancy risk among older breast cancer survivors.
    Authors: Hardell KNL, Schonfeld SJ, Ramin C, Vo JB, Morton LM
    Abstract: Type II diabetes is associated with cancer risk in the general population but has not been well-studied as a risk factor for subsequent malignancies among cancer survivors. We investigated the association between diabetes and subsequent cancer risk among older (66-84 years), one-year breast cancer survivors within the linked Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database using Cox regression analyses to quantify hazard ratios (HR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Among 133,324 women, 29.3% were diagnosed with diabetes prior- or concurrent to their breast cancer diagnosis, and 10,452 women developed subsequent malignancies over a median follow-up of 4.3 years. Diabetes was statistically significantly associated with liver (HR = 2.35, 95%CI=1.48-3.74), brain (HR = 1.94, 95%CI=1.26-2.96), and thyroid cancer risks (HR = 1.38, 95%CI=1.01-1.89). Future studies are needed to better understand the spectrum of subsequent cancers associated with diabetes and the role of diabetes medications in modifying subsequent cancer risk, alone or in combination with cancer treatments.

    Title: Impact of HIV status on prognosis of malignancies among people living with HIV in Japan.
    Authors: Ando K, Shimomura A, Watanabe K, Tsukada K, Teruya K, Gatanaga H, Shimizu C
    Abstract: BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy has reduced the incidence and mortality of AIDS-defining malignancies (ADM); however, non-AIDS-defining malignancies (NADM) are a major cause of death among people living with HIV (PLWH) today. Though current guidelines suggest that PLWH should receive the same treatment as the general population, there are limited studies focused on how HIV status affects the prognosis of cancers. The present study aimed to investigate the characteristics and prognosis of malignant diseases among PLWH in Japan. METHODS: Patients with HIV diagnosed with malignant diseases at our institution between 2011 and 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: There were 205 patients who were diagnosed with malignancies. Of these, 87 (42.4%) were diagnosed with ADM and 118 (57.6%) were diagnosed with NADM. Among 69 patients who received chemotherapy for ADM, 24 (34.8%) developed AIDS-defining opportunistic infections during treatment. In contrast, only one (1.8%) of the 56 patients administered chemotherapy for NADM developed AIDS-defining opportunistic infections. Complications of opportunistic infections at diagnosis of malignancies, low CD4(+) T-cell count, positive HIV RNA, and nonadministration of antiretroviral therapy were associated with 5-year overall survival among patients with malignant lymphomas. However, the variables associated with HIV did not affect NADM prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis, HIV status had a small impact on the prognosis of malignant diseases in PLWH. Few patients with NADM developed AIDS-defining opportunistic infections after receiving chemotherapy.

    Title: Transcriptomic analysis revealed potential regulatory biomarkers and repurposable drugs for breast cancer treatment.

    Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) is the most widespread cancer worldwide. Over 2 million new cases of BC were identified in 2020 alone. Despite previous studies, the lack of specific biomarkers and signaling pathways implicated in BC impedes the development of potential therapeutic strategies. We employed several RNAseq datasets to extract differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on the intersection of all datasets, followed by protein-protein interaction network construction. Using the shared DEGs, we also identified significant gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathways to understand the signaling pathways involved in BC development. A molecular docking simulation was performed to explore potential interactions between proteins and drugs. The intersection of the four datasets resulted in 146 DEGs common, including AURKB, PLK1, TTK, UBE2C, CDCA8, KIF15, and CDC45 that are significant hub-proteins associated with breastcancer development. These genes are crucial in complement activation, mitotic cytokinesis, aging, and cancer development. We identified key microRNAs (i.e., hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-1-3p, hsa-miR-147a, hsa-miR-195-5p, and hsa-miR-155-5p) that are associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor clinical outcomes in BC. Notable transcription factors (TFs) were FOXC1, GATA2, FOXL1, ZNF24 and NR2F6. These biomarkers are involved in regulating cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. Finally, molecular docking suggested Hesperidin, 2-amino-isoxazolopyridines, and NMS-P715 as potential lead compounds against BC progression. We believe that these findings will provide important insight into the BC progression as well as potential biomarkers and drug candidates for therapeutic development.

    Title: Surface-Functionalized Polymeric Nanoparticles for Breast Cancer Treatment: Processes and Advances.
    Authors: Prasad A, Bakr MM, ElMeshad AN
    Abstract: The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that of all the non-communicable diseases, cancer is considered the second cause of death worldwide. This has driven the big pharma companies to prioritize anticancer products in their pipeline. In addition, research has focused on exploration of new anticancer molecules and design of suitable dosage forms to achieve effective drug delivery to the tumor site. Nanotechnology is a valuable tool to build nano delivery systems with controlled and targeted drug release properties. Nanoparticles can be fabricated by robust, scalable and economic techniques using various polymers. Moreover, specific functional groups can be introduced to the surface of nanoparticles enabling targeting to a specific tissue; besides, they exhibit versatile drug release patterns according to the rate of polymer degradation. This review outlines the processes and advances in surface functionalization of nanoparticles employed for treatment of breast cancer. The therapeutic molecules, the polymers used to fabricate nanoparticles, the techniques used to prepare the nanoparticles have been reviewed with a focus on the processes employed to functionalize these nanoparticles with suitable ligands to target different types of breast cancer.
