# Basic Quiz Game

This is a simple quiz game where players can choose from different genres of quizzes such as Sports, Entertainment, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. Each genre contains five questions related to the chosen category. Players input their answers, and the program provides feedback on whether the answer is correct or incorrect along with the final score.

### Iterating over each item in the list above based on selected genre

```pyhton

        # Iterate over each question, display options, and check answers
        for question, options, answer in quiz_data[int(genre) - 1]:
            print(f"\nQuestion: {question}")
            for option in options:
                print(option)
            user_answer = input("Your answer (Enter 1, 2, or 3): ")
            if user_answer == answer:
                print("Correct!")
                score += 1
            else:
                print("Incorrect!")
```
### Giving the final score

```python
        # Print final score
        print(f"\nYour score is: {score}/5")
        time.sleep(2)  # Pause for 2 seconds before returning to the menu


```
