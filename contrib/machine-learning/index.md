# SUPERVISED LEARNING
Supervised learning is a category of machine learning which uses labeled datasets i.e, the datasets which has both input and output. This data is given to train algorithms to learn relationship between input and output to predict outcomes and recognize patterns.

Supervised learning can be divided into two parts -**Regression** and **Classification**.

# Regression
It is a statistical approach to find the correlation between the dependent(label) and independent(feature) variables.It is used to predict continuous/ real values of dependent variable.
- For example- *Predicting house price based on the square footage(area)*, As area of house increases the house rent also increases.
  
# Classification

In this approach the given dataset is classified into various categories based on the input features and specific labels are assigned and given as output. 
- For example- *Email spam detection*, emails are classified as spam or not spam .
