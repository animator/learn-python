                                                  # MultiThreading in python
    >> Introduction
           Multithreading in Python allows you to run multiple threads (smaller units of a process) simultaneously, enabling concurrent execution 
           of tasks. This can be particularly useful for I/O-bound operations or when you need to perform multiple operations at the same time.

    >> Why Use Multithreading?
         1.Improved performance: Allows multiple tasks to run concurrently, which can lead to more efficient utilization of resources.
         2.Responsive applications: Keeps your applications responsive, especially during long-running operations.
         3.Better resource utilization: Makes better use of system resources, especially in I/O-bound applications.

  - Threading Module
     Python's threading module provides a way to create and manage threads. It includes the Thread class, which represents an individual thread of 
     execution.

 **Creating a Thread**
     To create a new thread, you can instantiate the Thread class and provide a target function to be executed by the thread.


 -import threading

     def print_numbers():
         for i in range(1, 6):
            print(i)

     # Create a thread
      thread = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)

      # Start the thread
     thread.start()

     # Wait for the thread to complete
     thread.join()

 - Synchronizing Threads
        When multiple threads access shared resources, synchronization is necessary to avoid data corruption. The threading module provides 
      synchronization primitives like Lock, RLock, Semaphore, and Condition.

  - Example using Lock

    import threading

    lock = threading.Lock()

    def print_numbers():
        with lock:
           for i in range(1, 6):
             print(i)

    # Create multiple threads
     threads = [threading.Thread(target=print_numbers) for _ in range(3)]

    # Start the threads
    for thread in threads:
       thread.start()

     # Wait for all threads to complete
    for thread in threads:
      thread.join()

   - Thread Communication
       Threads can communicate using shared variables, but this requires careful synchronization. Another approach is to use thread-safe data 
        structures like Queue from the queue module.

    ** Example using Queue

    import threading
    import queue

    def worker(q):
       while not q.empty():
         item = q.get()
         print(f'Processing {item}')
         q.task_done()

    q = queue.Queue()

  # Add items to the queue
  for item in range(1, 11):
    q.put(item)

   # Create and start worker threads
   threads = [threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(q,)) for _ in range(3)]

   for thread in threads:
     thread.start()

  # Wait for all tasks to be processed
   q.join()
  Example: Multithreading in Python
    Let's create a more comprehensive example to demonstrate multithreading in a real-world scenario.

 - Example: Downloading Multiple URLs

   import threading
   import requests

   urls = [
    'http://example.com',
    'http://example.org',
    'http://example.net',
   ]

  def download_url(url):
     response = requests.get(url)
     print(f'Downloaded {url} with status {response.status_code}')

  threads = [threading.Thread(target=download_url, args=(url,)) for url in urls]

  for thread in threads:
    thread.start()

  for thread in threads:
    thread.join()

      >> Common Pitfalls
        1.Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): Python's GIL can limit the performance benefits of threading for CPU-bound tasks. Consider using 
         multiprocessing for such tasks.
        2.Race conditions: Ensure proper synchronization to avoid race conditions when accessing shared resources.
         Deadlocks: Be cautious of deadlocks when using multiple locks.

     >> Conclusion
          Multithreading in Python is a powerful tool for concurrent execution, especially for I/O-bound tasks. By understanding and correctly 
          implementing threading, you can significantly improve the performance and responsiveness of your applications.
