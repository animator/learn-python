# STACKS IN DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS
In Data Structures and Algorithms, a stack is a linear data structure that complies with the Last In, First Out (LIFO) rule. It works by use of two fundamental techniques: **PUSH** which inserts an element on top of the stack and **POP** which takes out the topmost element.This concept is similar to a stack of plates in a cafeteria. Stacks are usually used for handling function calls, expression evaluation, and parsing in programming. Indeed, they are efficient in managing memory as well as tracking program state. On top of that, stacks can be implemented either via arrays or linked lists. Their simplicity coupled with adaptability has made them an integral part of many Computer Science and Software Development applications across the globe.

**Points To Be Remembered :-**
- A stack is a collection of data ietms that can be accessed at only one end, called **TOP**.
- Items can be inserted and deleted in a stack oly at the *TOP*.
- The last item inserted in a stack is the first one to be deleted.
- Therefore, a stack is called a **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)** data structure.
